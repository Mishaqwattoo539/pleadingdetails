The implications of misbehavior are clear, yet the prosecutor is unlikely to be punished. There is no one-size-fits-all answer to the question of why someone does what they do &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.leahlegal.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.leahlegal.com&lt;/a&gt; . Although there are prosecutor-political conflicts of interest, there are also prosecutor-justice-seeking conflicts. For the most part, prosecutorial misconduct stems from one or more of the following three reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pressure to Convict&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the public doesn&amp;#39;t think prosecutors are &amp;quot;soft on crime,&amp;quot; it can be good. It&amp;#39;s virtually impossible to avoid bad consequences if you have a reputation for being generous with &amp;quot;lawbreakers.&amp;quot; Since high-profile cases draw attention from the media, the likelihood of prosecutorial misconduct increases &lt;a href=&quot;https://leahlegalvnca.weebly.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;best criminal attorney in california&lt;/a&gt;. Prosecutors may feel pressured to do &amp;quot;whatever it takes&amp;quot; to get a conviction when members of the public and government authorities are closely monitoring their actions. To preserve an image of being &amp;quot;tough on crime&amp;quot; is one of the most common motives for prosecutorial misconduct. Prosecutors may deliberately conceal or fabricate evidence in order to secure re-election. Prosecutors tend to take more cases to trial rather than lower the number of plea deals when they are seeking for re-election, according to recent studies in 2013.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Career Suicide for Those That Report Misconduct&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&amp;#39;re a member of the legal profession, you&amp;#39;ll likely benefit from keeping your coworkers happy. In order to get a favorable plea deal, it is usual practice for an attorney to cultivate a good working relationship with the prosecution &lt;a href=&quot;https://leahlegalvnca.wixsite.com/home&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;top criminal defense lawyers&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#39;s thus &amp;quot;career suicide&amp;quot; to expose prosecutorial malpractice. Although comradely aids in the creation and maintenance of pleasant working circumstances, it also prevents attorneys from denouncing wrongdoing without the fear of negative repercussions being incurred in the process. The American Bar Association&amp;#39;s Professional Conduct Rule 8.3(a) requires attorneys to report wrongdoing by their colleagues if they have any doubts about their integrity, honesty, or fitness to practice law. Despite the fact that this rule is crystal apparent, attorneys are often afraid of punishment from their colleagues in the legal profession. When justice is put ahead of comradery, it requires a lawyer who is committed to preserving the highest ethical standards. Motions will be filed with the court by a competent lawyer to guarantee that a judge does not rule on the basis of a prosecutor&amp;#39;s unethical or unlawful actions. In order to avoid an innocent person serving time in prison, winning motions raise the chances that a court may reduce a defendant&amp;#39;s sentence, dismiss the charges, or vacate a conviction.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/8284462809028900141/1608073038979524720/comments/default/7447758844425027222'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/8284462809028900141/1608073038979524720/comments/default/7447758844425027222'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://freelawservices.blogspot.com/2017/02/discharge-cancellationleading-case-laws.html?showComment=1650277492823#c7447758844425027222' title=''/><author><name>Armagh Garden Sheds NI</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/08749268380996562425</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='https://freelawservices.blogspot.com/2017/02/discharge-cancellationleading-case-laws.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8284462809028900141.post-1608073038979524720' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8284462809028900141/posts/default/1608073038979524720' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.itemClass" value="pid-891861442"/><gd:extendedProperty name="blogger.displayTime" value="April 18, 2022 at 3:24 AM"/></entry></feed>
