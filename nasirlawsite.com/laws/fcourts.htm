from the reading of these provisions that the Legislature intended that only
sums and applications under Guardians anti Wards Act were to be disposed of by
the Courts in which they were pending at the time of the coming into force of
the Act. In other words, the necessary implication and intendment derivable
from these two provisions is that all other matters pending at the time of the
coining into force of the Act will be taken up and disposed of by the new
forums created by the Act. This intendment is further supported by the use of
strong language in section 5 of the Act, wherein the words used are: “the
Family trout’s shall have exclusive jurisdiction to entertain, hear and
adjudicate upon matters specified in the Schedule”. Apart from stress on the exclusiveness
of the jurisdiction, the three stages of the proceedings are dealt with
separately, i.e.:---<o:p></o:p></span></p>

read into the section, therefore, it is not open to go beyond the statutory

Family Courts-Not persona designata or tribunals but Courts for all purposes as

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='color:red'>The various provisions In the West Pakistan Family Courts
Act, 1964, clearly point to the direction that the Tribunals constituted under
the Act are Courts in every sense. There is no indication or suggestion that it
is any persona designata who is to perform the functions mentioned. The
direction to the statute is to establish Courts and then there are laid down
the qualifications of the officers who can man this Court. The functions, which
the forum is required to perform, are all judicial. Each matter is to be
initiated by means of a suit which is to start by means of a plaint. The
plaints to suits before the Family Courts are in no way different from the
plaints under the Code of Civil Procedure. After the institution of a suit, by
means of a plaint, the process is issued to the defendant who is required to
file a written statement. Thereafter the issues are struck, evidence is
recorded and a judgment is pronounced which is to be followed by a decree. The
Act does not create any new rights, but it simply specifies the course in which
already existing rights of the parties with regard to dissolution of marriage,
dower, maintenance, restitution of conjugal rights, custody of children, and
guardianship may be enforced. The provisions of the Family Courts Act make it
clear that the intention of law is to set up Courts and entrust matters to them
in their capacity as Courts and not as a persona designata. Family Court is,
therefore, a Court of law as contemplated in Article 102 read with Article 242
of the Constitution.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='color:red'>According to section 14 of the Family Courts Act, 1964, in
such cases where a Family Court is presided over by a District Judge, an appeal
shall lie to the High Court and in any other case to the District Court, which,
according to section 2(21) of the West Pakistan General Clauses Act VI of 1956,
and section 2(4) of the C. P. C., means the principal Civil Court of original
civil jurisdiction of a district. In section 2(2) of the West Pakistan Family
Courts Act, 1964, it is laid down that, “words and expressions used in this Act
but not herein defined, shall have the meaning respectively assigned to them in
the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908:” A District Court, according to section 3 of
the Civil Procedure Code, is subordinate to the High Court and every civil
Court, of a grade inferior to that of a District Court, is subordinate to the
High Court and the District Court. A Family Court is thus, from all points of
views, a Court subordinate to the High Court within the meaning of Article 102
of the Constitution. <b>P L D 1968 Lah.987.</b><o:p></o:p></span></p>

asserted such facts, plaintiff discharged her onus to prove and it was for
defendant to lead evidence in rebuttal or to shake evidence of plaintiff
through cross-examination defendant failed to lead evidence in rebuttal,
therefore, he had to bear the consequences unless court had come to the
conclusion that value claimed in dowry articles was so disproportionate to the
known sources of income of family of bride or items were so out of scene with
the situation and standard of living of the family, it would be reasonable for
family court to require plaintiff before it to produce proof of income of her
family it was not alleged, and even if it was alleged, since defendant did not
produce any evidence, therefore, no such burden of proving income of parents of
bride could be lumped at the door of helpless woman same principle would be
held true regarding independent witness regarding purchase of dowry articles
high court found it unfair that after lapse of more than ten years to hold
plaintiff only entitled to recovery of articles because ten years was a long

then wife would be entitled to recover dower and dowry, but where it was
dissolved solely on the ground of Khula’ then her offer made for getting
marriage dissolved on Khula’ would be examined-Wife tiled suit for dissolution
of marriage on various grounds viz. cruelty, non-payment of maintenance,
non-performance of marital obligations, impotency of husband and Khula’-Wife
also filed suit for recovery of dowry amount-Family Court decreed the suit for
dissolution of marriage on all such grounds holding that wife in lieu of Khula’
would not be entitled to claim dower, dowry and maintenance -Husband, in view
of such findings, filed in latter suit an application for rejection of the
plaint-Wife filed application for clarification of judgment and decree, but it
was dismissed by Family Court and its order was maintained by the Appellate
Court-High Court accepted Constitutional petition tiled by wife and set aside
the conditions regarding relinquishment of dower, dowry and
maintenance-Contention of husband was that High Court in exercise of
Constitutional jurisdiction could not change judgment and decree passed by
Family Court, especially when the wife had not challenged same and her petition
for clarification had been dismissed by Courts below-Held’: wife in her
deposition recorded before Family Court had forgiven only her claim for
remaining amount of dower in lieu of Khula’ and had not given up her claim of
dowry-Marriage was dissolved on various ‘rounds including Khula’-Where marriage
was dissolved on other grounds also, then wife would be entitled to recover
amount of dower and dowry, but where it was dissolved solely on ground of Khula’,
then situation would be different and it would be examined keeping in view the
offer she had made for getting marriage dissolved on Khula­ Findings of High
Court were correct and not open to any exception. ­Supreme Court dismissed the
appeal of husband while making it clear that suit tiled by wife for recovery of
dowry amount would be decided on its own merits. <span class=HTMLMarkup>--&gt;</span>P

Rules, 1965, being enabling provision is for benefit of wife and it can be read
in that context when estranged wife who has left her husband’s abode and has
sought residence at any other place of her own choice and proves that she had
been ordinarily residing over there, then Family Court cannot refuse
jurisdiction to hear her suit, when she invokes jurisdiction by filing family

style='color:red'>At the pre-trial proceedings</span></b><span
style='color:red'>, the Court has first to ascertain the points at issue
between the parties and an attempt is to be made by the Court to effect a
compromise or reconciliation between the parties. Section 10, no doubt,
contemplates presence of the parties concerned before the Court at the
pre-trial hearing, but according to subsection (4) thereof, if no compromise or
reconciliation is possible, the Court has to frame issues in the case and fix a
date for recording evidence. There is, therefore, no such provision in section
10, under which ex parte proceedings can be ordered due to non-appearance of a
party. The only provision in the Act which empowers the `Family Court to
proceed ex parte is contained in section 9(5), but the same can be pressed into
service only when the defendant in the case fails to appear on the date fixed
by the Court for his appearance and the summons or notice was duly served on
him. If the petitioner could not attend the Court, all that the Family Judge
was required to do under subsection (4) of section 10 was to frame issues
and-fix a date for recording of evidence. Since the Act is a Special Law, the
procedure provided therein has to be strictly followed. There is no provision
in the Act for fixing the case for ex parte proof in absence of the defendant at
a pre-trial hearing. <b>1987 M L D 492<o:p></o:p></b></span></p>

the powers conferred on the execution Court, the legislature has vested a
discretion in the Court, to realise the decretal amount as arrears of land

execution proceedings for the recovery of dowry articles-Husband raised
objection to the maintainability of the proceedings on the ground that as the
wife did not perform her part of agreement, therefore, the execution of
compromise decree would be a partial execution- Family Court disallowed the
objection, while the Appellate Court accepted the appeal and directed the
Family Court to restore the suit for recovery of dowry
articles-Validity-Execution of the decree in favour of the wife for the return
of the dowry articles would amount to execution of a partial decree in her
favour which was not just and proper as the Executing Court could not do the
same, because the wife had released herself from performing her obligation on
her side under the decree granted in favour of the husband-If the wife would be
allowed to execute the decree, the same would amount on the part of Executing
Court to go behind the decree which could not be done--Seeking partial
execution of decree by a person without fulfilling his own obligation under the
same decree disentitled the person from seeking the requisite relief-Order

One, to follow the ‘ course of recovery of decretal amount as arrears of land
revenue and in this regard it is required to issue a direction specifically in
compliance with subsection (3) of section 13 of the Act. Or, it will adopt
other means to effect the recovery of the decretal amount. Failure on the part
of a decree-holder to make the payment of the decretal amount within the time
specified by an executing Court shall not ipso facto make it obligatory on the
Court to recover the same as arrears of land revenue but it is dependent upon
its discretion and only if the Court so directs the recovery shall be resorted
to as arrears of land revenue. It will be then that the mode prescribed by

- Bar contained in S.17, West Pakistan Family Courts Act, 1964, excluding
applicability of provisions of Evidence Act, 1872, not applicable to provisions
of Qanun-e-Shahadat , 1984 - Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984, being later in time than
Family Courts Act, 1964, and of an overriding character, any provision in tile
Act Of 1964, which directly comes into conflict with anything enjoined in
Qanun-e-Shahadat would make way, at least to the extent of inconsistency -
Provisions of Arts.102 &amp; 103, Qanun-e-Shahadat would thus be applicable to
proceedings under West Pakistan Family Courts Act, 1964. The Qanun-E-Shahadat ,
1984, pursuant to Article 1(2) thereof, has been made applicable to all
judicial proceedings in or before any Court, including a Court martial, a
Tribunal or other Authority exercising judicial or ‘quasi-judicial powers or
jurisdiction except those in arbitrations. “Court”, under the Qanun-e-Shahadat
per Article 2(l)(a), includes all Judges and Magistrates, and all persons,
except arbitrators, legally -authorized to take evidence. It is, however,
manifest that the West Pakistan Family Courts Act, 1964, in section (in 11
thereof, lays down its own procedure for recording of evidence and in its
section 17, except when expressly provided in such Act, categorically excludes
the applicability of the Evidence Act, 1872 and the Code of Civil Procedure,
1908. Still, the Oanun-e-Shahadat , 1984, being a subsequent legislation could
not be anticipated in the 1964 promulgation and the postulates of that statute,
being later in time than the Family Courts Act, 1964, and of and overriding
character, should reflect on the bar in the enactment last mentioned. Qanun-e
Shahdat , 1984, largely and, often enough even verbatim re-enacted the Evidence
Act, 1872, which it repealed and which was expressly excluded from the
proceedings in Family Courts. In law, the Qanun-e-Shahadat and the Evidence Act
is independent and distinct statutes and exclusion or ouster of one could not
be equated with that of the other: The Oanun-e-Shahadat, remaining unaffected
by the bar in section 17 of the Family Courts Act, 1964, any provision in the
Act of 1964, which directly comes in conflict with anything enjoined in the
Oanun-e-Shahadat would make way, at least to the extent of inconsistency.
Because the 1964 Act is a provincial enactment, as regards the constitutional
mandate for the Federal Legislature on the topic the subjects occur in the
Concurrent Legislative List of the Fourth Schedule to the Constitution at items
Nos. 4 and 5 as “Evidence and Oath; recognition of laws, Public Acts and

plaint filed before a Family Court shall be Re. 1. The concession with regard
to reduction in the court-fee is restricted to a ‘plaint’. The omission of ‘memorandum
of appeal’ in this section is significant, particularly, as both a plaint and a
memorandum of appeal are included in Article 1, Schedule I of the Court Fees
Act, as attracting ad valorem court-fees. On the principle of expression ‘unius
est exclusio alterius’ (the express mention of one implies the exclusion of the

of section 19 of the said Act, the ‘memorandum of appeal’. The concession with
regard to payment of court-fees on a ‘plaint’ filed before a Family Court,

style='color:red'>Taking up dissolutions of marriages under the Family Courts
Act, 1964, subsection (3) of section 21 thereof expressly provides that,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any other law, a decree
for dissolution of marriage solemnized under the Muslim Law would not be
effective until the expiration of 90 days from the date on which a copy thereof
had been sent under section 21 (2) to the Chairman and be of no effect if
within the period specified a reconciliation had been effected between the
parties in accordance With the provisions of the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance,
1961. While room for reconciliation was left open in the foregoing provisions,
manifestly, the express. or implied revocation of TALAQ, as envisioned in
section 7 (3) of the Ordinance, is a provision applicable to TALAQS, as such,
alone and not to dissolutions of marriages by a Family Court and one of the
parties to the marriage, by resorting to a one-sided act, could not nullify a
lawful decree of dissolution. Such, however, much the same way as above
adverted, could be overtaken on the basis of a mutual or bilateral arrangement
between the spouses: All references to “Mutuality” in this discourse, had been
made deliberately, for even where the dissolution had emanated from or
initiated by a wife, she also could not by herself decide to return, the husband
always having and retaining the power of TALAQ. Once, therefore, a marriage was
dissolved by a Court of law competently and due notice was “sent” or “delivered”,
unless and only when the spouses make up and reconcile the dissolution would
become irrevocably effective on the expiry of 90 days from the date the
requisite notice under section 7 (3) of the Ordinance was “delivered” or under
section, 21 of the Act was “sent”. The efforts towards conciliation have always
been held to be persuasive and not compulsive. Besides, while a good deal of
solemnity would attach to these efforts, the same have yet been found to be
directory rather than mandatory. <b>1991 M L D 403<o:p></o:p></b></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='color:red'>Dissolution of marriage under the Family Courts Act, 1964,
once having attained finality, cannot be revoked except upon reconciliation of
the spouses and that, non-service of notice of such a decree does not make it
ineffective, the question that is to be addressed is as to what would be the
effect of a woman remarrying before the expiry of the statutory period of
notice, prescribed as a condition for the conclusiveness of a dissolution
4ecreP. It would appear that revocation of such a decree, being dependent on
mutuality of the parties, service of notice of the decree, in terms of section
21 of the Family Courts Act or sections 7 and 8 of the Muslim Family Laws
Ordinance, as applicable, would essentially be in the nature of a procedural or
technical requirement and once that notice is shown to have been “sent”/”delivered”
or presumed to have been “sent”/”delivered”, as relevant, the wife, for all
practical purposes, may, at her option, be considered to be virtually in the
state of Iddat. The situation can logically be compared and even equated with
the co-extensiveness of the period requisite for divorce in the way of Talaq
Ahsan and Talaq Hasan and that of Iddat, each, substantially, involving three
lunar months and running concurrently. Contingencies in the nature of pregnancy
are not likely to be confronted in these situations but if that be so at all
the period involved would stand extended PRO TANTO though that too may be
limited to the Punjab for section 21 of the Family Courts Act, as it stands in
other parts of Pakistan, does not envisage such a development. On this premises
and this analogy, a woman, holding a decree of dissolution and upon service of
the applicable notice, re-marrying, can aptly be described as’ a woman
re-marrying during her Iddat. Inter alia, no different incidents should follow
upon service of the required notice in cases of dissolution by way of Tafweez,
Khayar-ul-Balooch, Mubara’at and Khnla (with consent and out of Court); in the
first two modes the wife alone having the option to revoke and in the last two
revocation being dependent on mutuality. Re-marriage during Iddat, is only
irregular and not void and becomes valid (Sahih) or regularized upon the expiry
of the Iddat period. The off springs of such marriage are legitimate. Still,
the English word “irregular” applied to such marriages is not properly
reflective of the connotations carried in the idea for which the Arabic version
of “Fasid” alone is apposite, which can only be a degree short of “void” or “Batil”.
The foregoing deductions would apply only to cases where the husband does not
have reserved in himself the power to revoke the severence of the martial tie.
Further, even in the events above covered, it is not only to be hoped but
expected that the spouse concerned would revile the sanctity of Iddat, if at
all, only in compelling circumstances, as a last resort and never otherwise. <b>1991

appropriate Chairman referred to in section 7 of the Muslim Family Laws
Ordinance, 1961 and upon receipt of such copy, the Chairman shall proceed as if
he had received an intimation of talaq required to be given under the said

intention of the Legislature appears to be that the copy of such a decree
should be sent invariably so that the provision of subsection (4) of section 7
of the Ordinance should be complied with. The word “shall” prefixed before the
words “send by registered post” makes that intention clear and it is mandatory
in that context. However, the requirement relative to the time within which it
has to be sent is directory, for no consequence is provided if the copy of such
a decree is not sent within 7 days. Therefore, nothing will turn on the delay
in sending the certified copy, for under subsection (3) of section 7 of the
Ordinance, it is in fact the date on which the copy is received by the Chairman
that will be material in computing the period of 90 days. Even under subsection
(3) of section 21 of the Act it is the date on which the copy is sent to the
Chairman. This provision has to be read subject to subsection (4) of section 7
of the Ordinance as this provision has been made applicable to a decree for the
dissolution of marriage by subsection (1) of section 21 of the Act. It could
not, therefore, be said that the decree became ineffective if its copy had not
been sent within 7 days, for the date that is relevant is that on which it is
received and 90 days have to be computed from that date<b>.-P L D 1971 Kar 118<o:p></o:p></b></span></p>

further protection by sections 5 and 21 of the West Pakistan Family Courts Act,

On the basis of section 25 of the West Pakistan Family Courts Act, 1964 it was
argued that a litigant aggrieved by the order of a Family Court, in the
guardianship matters, had the right of appeal and revision prescribed under the
Guardians and Wards Act, 1890. On the other hand it was urged that the
provisions for challenging .orders of the Family Court were exhaustively set
out in section 14 of the West Pakistan Family Courts Act, 1964 which was an overriding
section and that section 25 of the 1964Act merely attracted to the Family Court
the procedure of the Guardians and Wards Act, 1890. The matter was referred to
a Full Bench and the questions formulated for decision were:---<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='color:red'>(i) Whether in a decision by the Family Court, under the
Guardians and Wards Act, where the Presiding Officer is not a District Judge or
one of equivalent rank, does an appeal lie at all and if so to which forum?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='color:red'>(ii) Whether the Family Court under the West Pakistan Family
Courts Act, 1964 is a Court under the supervisory jurisdiction of the High
Court under section 115, C. P. C. 7 <br>
Held: It is true that section 25 of the West Pakistan Family Courts Act, 1964
expressly refers to the Guardians and Wards Act, 1890, but it is significant
that the opening words of section 14 of the Family Courts Act, 1964 read: “Notwithstanding
anything provided in any other law for the time being in force.” The clear
effect of these words is to exclude any provisions of the Guardians and Wards
Act which may be contrary to section 14. Even otherwise section 25 merely
prescribes that a Family Court shall be deemed to be a District Court. But a
deeming clause creates a legal fiction and has to be construed strictly.
therefore as the Legislature has only enacted that the Family Court is deemed
to be a District Court, it means that it Is not a District Court, but that
merely for the purpose specified in the section it would have the it atus and
powers of a District Court. Additionally the right of appeal against an order
of a Court cannot possibly be described as the status and powers of that Court.
There fore the deeming provision in section 25 of the said Act, cannot possibly
lead to the conclusion that it confers on a litigant aggrieved by a judgment of
a Family Court the rights of appeal and revision contained in the Guardians and
Wards Act. Merely because a Family Court is deemed to be a District Court, an
order passed by it cannot be treated as an order of the District Court nor does
it become appeal able to High Court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='color:red'>Now, although section 25 is an overriding provision, it
relates only to procedure. The view that procedure does not include a right of
appeal “does not admit of doubt.” It is now too late in the day even to argue
that the word “procedure” can include the right of appeal, which is a
substantive right. Aright of appeal is a creature of the statute, and as the
language of section 14 of the Family Courts Act is plain beyond any doubt the
Courts have to give effect to it. The meaning of the word “procedure” cannot be
altered nor is it necessary to do so because there is no lacuna in section 14.

5 of the West Pakistan Family Courts Act of 1964 confers exclusive jurisdiction
on the Family Court to adjudicate upon matters specified in the Schedule of
which item No. 5 refers to the custody of children. This provision has been
made subject to the provisions contained in the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance of
1961 and the Conciliation Courts Ordinance of 1961. Section 25 of the West
Pakistan Family Courts Act, 1964 confers on the Family Court the status of a
District Court for the purpose of Guardians and Wards Act and further provides
that while dealing with these matters the same procedure as prescribed under
the Guardians and Wards Act shall be followed. Section 47 of the Guardians and
Wards Act catalogues orders made by a Court which are all appealable to the
High Court, of which claw; (c) refers to an order made under section 25.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Family Courts Act of 1964 having exclusive jurisdiction to deal, inter alga,

laid down in section 4(4), Guardians and Wards Act and section 2(4), C. P. C.
except that the deeming provision contained in section 25 of the West Pakistan
Family Courts Act, 1964 has conferred that status on it while dealing with
cases under the Guardians and Wards Act.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='color:red'>Since under section 25 of the West Pakistan Family Courts
Act, 1964 the Family Court has to be equated with a District Court for the
purposes of cases under the Guardians and Wards Act, it appears that sub-clause
(b) of subsection (1) of section 14 would be straightway excluded inasmuch as
the order passed by the Family Court in a case of this kind would be only in
its capacity as a District Court and no Court can hear an appeal against its
own order or from that of a concurrent jurisdiction. Likewise, clause (a) would
also be inapplicable inasmuch is it would be invoked only in a case where the
Family Court is presided over by a District Judge, an Additional District Judge
or a person notified by Government to be of the rank and of the status of a
District Judge or an Additional District Judge. It appears than where a Civil
Judge, 1st Class, functions as a Family Court while dealing with a case
relating to the custody or guardianship, of a minor, the rank and status of an
Addl. District Judge must be conferred on him, by means of a notification in
order to make his order appeal able under clause (a) of subsection (1) of
section 14.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='color:red'>The rider attached to the provision contained in section 14
opening with the expression “notwithstanding anything provided in any other law
for the time being in force”, makes it abundantly clear that all other
provisions relating to appeals contained in other relevant laws, including
those of section 47 of the Guardians and Wards Act would be excluded from
operation. But this provision has been subjected to a further limitation by the
words “and notwithstanding anything contained in this Act” as occurring in
section 25 of the West Pakistan Family Courts Act, 1964. Ordinarily the word “procedure”
connotes details of the mode of trial to be adopted in a particular Court and
would not include the provisions relating to appeal, but in view of the
expression “in dealing with the matters specified in that Act, follow the
procedure prescribed in that Act” coupled with the inevitable consequence that
the order in question would not be governed by any of the provisions contained
in section 14 so as to make it appealable, it is clear that the only proper
interpretation that can be placed on sections 14 and 25 of the Act read
together is that for the purposes of appeal, against an order of the
Administrative Civil Judge functioning as Family Court holding a party entitled
to custody of minors, section 47 of the Guardians and Wards Act would be
applicable and accordingly an appeal would be competent to the High Court. <b>P

for making application for setting aside an ex parte decree passed by Family
Court but R .13, West Pakistan Family Courts Rules, 1965 prescribing limitation
period of 30 days--Rule 13 therefore was <i>ultra vires</i>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-align:justify'><span
style='color:red'>The statute provided no time limitation for making
application for setting aside an ex parte decree passed by a Family Court. This
is not a case where the statute is silent with regard to the period of
limitation for making an application of this nature, but a positive provision
has been made permitting the making of such application “within reasonable time
of the passing” of the ex parte decree. The question is whether in the face of
such statutory provisions, the rule-making authority could frame a rule in any
way limiting the period of limitation to a fixed period. The rule-making power
has been vested in the Government under section 26 of the Family Courts Act for
making rules to carry into effect the provisions of the Act. When the Act
itself provides for making the application within reasonable time, apparently
fixing a period of limitation for general application to all cases, it cannot
be in consonance with the provisions of the Act and cannot be said to carry
into effect the provisions of the Act. The reason is that the question of what
constitutes reasonable time would obviously depend upon the facts of each
particular case and it will not be possible to lay down a rule of thumb that in
all cases the fixed period of 30 days would be reasonable time. Subsection (2)
of section 26 clearly expresses the legislative intent that the rules made
thereunder shall not be inconsistent with the provisions of the Act The

by wife in Civil court, prior to amendment in West Pakistan Family courts Act,
1964—After the amendment, such recovery was included in the Schedule of the
West Pakistan Family Courts Act, 1964, and the suit was decreed by family Court
in favour of wife—Judgment and decree passed by Family Court was maintained by
Appellate court as well as by High court—Plea raised by husband was that Family
court had no jurisdiction over the matter as the same was filed before Civil
Court—Validity—By the change of forum, nobody would have a vested right to a
particular forum to try his lis—Change of forum was a procedural matter and the
same operated retrospectively—Supreme court declined to interfere with the
judgments and decrees passed by the courts below—Leave to appeal was refused.

style='color:red'>Decree for maintenance of wife and children with effect from
1992, passed on 15-11-1995—Execution of decree failed and petitioner (husband)
was sent to civil prison and later was released on bail but further opportunity
given to him proved futile and bail was cancelled and he was again
arrested—petitioner approached the High Court in its Constitutional
jurisdiction and he was allowed interim bail subject to furnishing bail bond in
the sum of Rs. 50,000 with a surety; order of granting bail was, however, in
the background of the compromise made before the High Court that if released on
bail he shall be discharging his liability under the decree—Petitioner informed
the High Court that if released on bail he shall be discharging his liability
under the decree—Petitioner informed the High Court that he well be getting his
G.P. Fund shortly which he shall be depositing before the executing Court and
further that he shall be paying his debts under the decree in instalments as he
was not in a position to a pay the same in lump sum- Held, regarding his prayer
that the decretal amount be received through instalments, he may repeat the
prayer before the executing Court, who may review the same pragmatically and
keeping in view the economic condition of the petitioner—Petitioner, having
undertaken to pay the gratuity amount which he would receive within a period of
six weeks from the date of present judgment, it was considered to be proper to
extend his interim bail until 14th of December, 2002—If the petitioner made
part payment, he would earn the sympathy of the executing Court for extending
to him such concession for discharging his liabilities as are proper but if he
failed, then he would be at the mercy of the executing Court as the present
order of the High Court extending his interim bail shall abate. <b>PLD 2003

for recovery of maintenance for minor girl filed by wife was resisted by
husband alleging that minor girl being not his legitimate daughter, he was not
responsible for her maintenance allowance—Minor girl was born in 7th month of
the marriage—Minor girl born during the said wedlock, was not illegitimate, but
was lawful child of the parties—Whenever wife was charged with adultery,
husband would be required to substantiate his accusation of adultery by
producing four witnesses, but if no evidence except himself was available,
husband would take Oath or Lain—If wife also, took Oath, no chances of
retraction of charge of adultery would remain with husband and he could be
punished if he would retract and retraction would amount to acknowledgement by
husband—Child who was born within sim months of a valid wedlock was a
legitimate child under Islamic law—Minor girl born 7th month of wedlock was
lawful child of husband especially when birth entry of minor girl was got
registered by the husband—Husband was rightly held responsible to pay
maintenance allowance to minor girl in circumstances. <b>PLD 2003 Lah. 264<o:p></o:p></b></span></p>

wife had been made victim of cruelty and that she had developed hatred against
her husband and that she could not live in matrimonial bondage with him—Factum

even of the husband—Basis of Khula’ though was the return of consideration of
benefit already received by the wife, but khula’ could also be granted to wife
on the basis of facts and circumstances showing that matrimonial union of
spouses could not remain within the limits ordained by Allah—Whenever court
would home to the conclusion after looking into evidence that factum of cruelty
had been proved, then Court would gibe a release to wife from matrimonial
ties—Evidence on record, in the present case, had proved that downer amount,
though was paid by the husband to wife at the time of Nikah, but same was
immediately taken back from her—Family Court having dissolved marriage on basis
of Khula’ suit fro restitution of conjugal rights filed by defendant husband
against plaintiff wife was rightly considered as infructuous – Omission of
Family Court to give finding in suit for restitution of conjugal right filed by
husband, would not affect merits of case of wife for dissolution of marriage on
