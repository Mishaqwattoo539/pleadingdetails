Muhammad who delivered award and the present petitioners were declared to be

property by way of family settlement to his heirs from both the wives, he
ceased to be the owner thereof, therefore, any gift allegedly made by him even

basis of which the parties had become the owners of the disputed land apart
from the fact that the proceedings in the said suit in which arbitration was

present respondents filed a suit claiming therein that Mst. Noor Khatoon
predecessors-in-interest of the petitioners mentioned at No.1 and her brother
Ghulam Muhammad had sold the suit-land to them and after receiving the sale
consideration of Rs.2,495 handed over possession of the same to them; that
Mutation No.1555 was entered on 13-4-1974 on the statement of the said sellers
regarding the said sale; that on 16-4-1974 the said sellers appeared before the
Revenue Officer and again made a statement that they had sold the land in
question to the plaintiffs and had received the sale price; that the plaintiffs
were then asked to deposit District Council Fee which they deposited on
8-6-1974 and that when the said mutation came up for final attestation on
23-5-1975 it was declared by the Assistant Collector that even the sales of
agricultural land were to be made through registered sale-deed and since the
sale in question was an oral sale, therefore, the mutation could not be
sanctioned. This led the plaintiffs to the <st1:Street w:st="on"><st1:address
 w:st="on">Civil Court</st1:address></st1:Street> seeking a declaration that
they were owners in possession of the land in question and that the order of
the Assistant Collector dated 23-5-1975 refusing the sanctioning of the
above-mentioned mutation was illegal.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-align:justify'><b><span
style='mso-bidi-font-family:"Book Antiqua"'>2. This suit was decreed by a
learned Civil Judge at Alipur, through a judgment, dated 26-10-1986 but on
appeal filed by the defendants the said judgment and decree was set aside and
the suit of the plaintiffs was dismissed through a judgment dated 5-7-1987. The
plaintiffs then approached the Lahore High Court with R.S.A. No.134 of 1987
which appeal was allowed through a judgment dated 14-5-2002 restoring the
judgment and decree of the learned trial Court as a result whereof the suit of
the plaintiffs was decreed.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-align:justify'><b><span
style='mso-bidi-font-family:"Book Antiqua"'>4. The reasons which had weighed
with the learned Judge in Chambers in allowing the R.S.A. were essentially that
the sellers had made a statement before the Patwari on 13-4-1974 declaring that
they had sold the suit-land to the buyers and had even handed over possession
of the same to them. It had also been noticed by the learned Single Judge that
the same sellers again appeared before the Revenue Officer i.e. Assistant
Collector grade-I on 16-4-1974 and confirmed the factum of the said sale. The
learned High Court thus came to the conclusion that in view of the said
statements of the buyers appearing in Mutation No.1555 (Exh.P.1), the sale in
question was complete in the month of April, 1974 and consequently the
notification of the Government of Punjab dated 30-12-1974 whereby the provisions
of section 54 of the Transfer of Property Act had been made applicable to the
sales of the agricultural land did not affect the sale in question which stood
completed more than eight months before this issuance of the said notification.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

An intention that an interest shall not be vested is not to be inferred merely
from a provision whereby the enjoyment thereof is postponed, or whereby a prior

whereby income arising from the property is directed to be accumulated until
the time of enjoyment arrives, or from a provision that if a particular event

contingent interest in the property. Such interest becomes a vested interest,
in the former case, on the happening of the event, in the latter, when the
happening of the event becomes impossible.</p>

A mortgage is the transfer of an interest in specific immovable property for
the purpose of securing the payment of money advanced or to be advanced by way
of loan, an existing or future debt or the performance of an engagement which
may give rise to a pecuniary liability.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-align:justify'>The transferor
is called a mortgagor, the transferee a mortgagee, the principal money and interest
of which payment is secured for the time being are called the mortgage&#8209;money
and the instrument (if any) by which the transfer is effected is called a
mortgage&#8209;deed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-align:justify'><b>(b) Simple
mortgage.</b> Where, without delivering possession of the mortgaged property,
the mortgagor binds himself personally to pay the mortgage money, and agrees
expressly or implied, that, in the event of his failing to pay according to his
contract, the mortgagee shall have a right to cause the mortgaged property to
be sold and the proceeds of sale to be applied, so far as may be necessary, in
payment of the mortgage&#8209;money, the transaction is called a simple
mortgagee.</p>

shall become absolute; </p>

Usufructurary mortgage.</b> Where the mortgagor delivers possession or
expressly or by implication binds himself to deliver possession of the

accruing from the property  or any part of such rents and profits and to
appropriate the same in lieu of interest, or in payment of the mortgage&#8209;money,

mortgagee, but subject to a proviso that he will re&#8209;transfer &#8209; it
to the mortgagor upon payment of the mortgage&#8209;money as agreed, the
transaction is called an English mortgage.</p>
