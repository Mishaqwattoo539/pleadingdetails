that the interest of consumers are inadequately represented and protected
within the Federal Government and that vigorous representation and protection
of the interest of consumers are essential to the fair and efficient functioning
of a free market economy. Each year, as a results of this lack of effective
representation before Federal agencies and courts, consumers suffer personal
injury, economic harm, and other adverse consequences in the course of
acquiring and using goods and services available in the marketplace. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
