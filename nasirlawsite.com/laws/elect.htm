like conventional signatures identify a person or entity signing a document, <b>Electronic
Signature [2(n)]</b>recognizes the signer of a document electronically signed.
Each electronic signature stocks information about the signer and about the
exact state of the document when it was electronically signed (also digitally
signed). When a person views a signed document, he can authenticate the
signature to verify the identity of the signer and to confirm that the document
has not been intercepted or altered by any intervener after it was
electronically signed by the signer. By adding an electronic signature to a
document, the signer intended to attest the document in its present form.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

electronic signature may be a handwritten name, a logo or other graphic of an
establishment, or text. The particular appearance of a signature is determined by
the certificate service provider. Some certificate service providers also allow
a signature to be invisible. (It is important to note that the appearance of a
signature is just its representation on the page and is not the actual
electronic signature information). An electronic signature may be (i) Text
signature [e.g. Name] (ii) Graphic signature [e.g. a company logo] (iii)
Handwritten name signature [an image file/scanned signature]. </span><br>

<span style='font-family:Verdana'>In the Ordinance, two types of electronic
signatures are defined. One is simply; electronic signature and another is <b>Advanced
Electronic Signature [2(e)]</b>. In advanced electronic signatures there is a
third party to whom both the parties trust. This trusted third party is the
Certification Service Providers who is entrusted with the responsibility of
verifying the senders identity. An <b>Accredited Certification Service
Providers [2(c)]</b>is one who holds a valid <b>Accreditation Certificate
[2(a)]</b> issued by the <b>Certification Council [2(b)]</b> under section
24 of the Ordinance. The sender/originator first registers with the
certification authority for an electronic identity. This electronic identity
takes the form of an electronic signature issued to the sender/originator by a
certification service provider. Such identity is only known to the
sender/originator. The sender/originator affixes with the message such unique
signature as electronic signature. When the message is received by the
recipient/addressee, the recipient/addressee checks such signatures from a
trusted certification authority or a trusted <b>repository [2(w)]</b>
(information storage house established and managed by Certification Council
under section 23 of the Ordinance) to check the senders/originators real
identity.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
