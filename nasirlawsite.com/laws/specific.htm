certain period - Tenant was regularly depositing rent in Court and thus was
entitled to appropriate relief - In view of conduct of parties, appropriate

showing handing over possession of shop by tenant - Tenant denied execution of
any document or handing over possession of ship to any of the defendants, and
further prayed for cancellation of documents being fraudulent - Contention ot
defendants was that on account of additional reliefs clamied through amended

allottee-members of a Society to part with rights and interest in share capital
or property allotted to them in Society in favour of a third party and society
was generally not arrayed as party to agreement or suit - Dispute essentially

respondent, filed in Trial Court application under S. 12(2), C.P.C. for setting

having moved application for extension of time to deposit amount specified in

which was registered document was produced in Court and besides marginal
witness, scriber of document was also produced in Court to support sale
agreement. Defendants claim that he had thumb-marked document in question, on
assumption that the same was lease deed and not sale-deed as had been agreed
between parties. Defendant thus, had not disputed thumb-impressions on document
in question and he had not even disputed, presence of witnesses mentioned in
document of sale.&nbsp; Marginal witness and scriber of sale-deed testified
before Court that sale deed was executed on instructions of defendant and that
after hearing contents of document he had signed the same in their presence.
Plaintiff, thus, had discharged onus to prove agreement which was otherwise
registered deed. Defendant having taken contra version was legally bound to
prove that he did not intend to execute sale agreement but intended to execute
lease deed but he failed to do so. Defendnats objection that second witness
was not produced was of no effect, in as much as, besides marginal witness,
deed writer was also produced who was practically witness of document as he had
claimed that such document was scribed on the instruction of defendant and that
the same had been attested in his presence. Objection of recording statement of
one of plaintiffs after evidence of defendant having not been raised before
Trial Court and even in grounds of appeal could not be allowed to be raised at
the stage of argument for the first time before High Court. No misreading of
evidence or error of law having been pointed out, no interference was warranted
in Judgment and decree of Trial Court. Plaintiff was directed to deposit
balance amount in Court by specified date if the same had not been deposited so
far.<b>&nbsp; P.L.J.2000 Lah. 1956</b>.&nbsp; Concurrent findings by courts
below are in favour of respondent. It would be too much for respondent to be
deprived of property, which was agreed to be sold to him ten years back and of
which he paid 5/6 part of price. It would be inequitable as well as immoral to
deprive respondent of fruit of sale agreement<b>.&nbsp; P.L.J.1997 SC 681 =
1997 SCMR 1006 =&nbsp; NLR 1997 Civil 558.</b> Concurrent findings of Courts
below on basis of weight of evidence. Concurrent findings on sale consideration
were correctly arrived at and they were not against weight of evidence.
Defendants stand was evasive with regard to their assertions in written statement
while it was proved in evidence that litigation had concluded; that upper
portion of house in question, had gone to another party; that permanent
transfer deed was ready for delivery and that the same had not been collected
by defendants to avoid execution of agreement in question. Nothing was brought
in evidence by defendants to show that transaction m question, was
unconsciousable and oppressive, therefore, concurrent findings arrived at by
two Courts-below were well reasoned, supported by evidence on record, and being
not against law, would not call for interference.-P.L.J.2000 Lah. 474. Suit for
specific performance on basis of agreement to sell was dismissed by Appellate
Court in post remand proceedings. Appellate Court had incorrectly found that agreement
to sell was not valid agreement enforceable under law, in as much as, when
defendant had executed the same he was not owner of land in question. Person
entering into agreement of sale of property having imperfect title, however,
would bound to make the contract on subsequently acquiring interest in such
property. Agreement to sell, thus, became enforceable by petitioner (plaintiff)
through Courts when executant/ defendant acquired interest in property in
question. Agreement to sell in favour of plaintiff was also prior in time than
that of agreement of association entered into between defendants inter se.
Evidence on record established that defendant (vendor) had backed out of
agreement to sell on acquisition of title and had entered into agreement of
association with co-defendant without consent of plaintiff. Plaintiff was thus,
bona fide purchaser of property in question, for value co-defendant having
subsequently entered into agreement with vendor (defendant) with knowledge of
prior agreement to sell, therefore, he was not entitled to protection in terms
ofS. 27, of Specific Relief Act 1877. Dismissal of plaintiffs suit being based
on misreading of evidence and the law, was set aside and plaintiffs suit was
decreed on direction that he would deposit remaining price of land in Court
before specified date.<b>&nbsp; P.L.J.2000 Lah. 1987</b> Plaintiffs suit was
decreed by trial Court, while in appeal the same was dismissed. Validity.
Deceased owner i.e., predecessor of defendants had entered into valid,
agreement with plaintiff through his attorney duly constituted by him.
Execution of registered General Power of attorney was not denied by attorney of
defendants while appearing as only witness on behalf of defendants. Agreement
in question, was even proved through scribe and marginal witness. Trial Court
had, thus, rightly decreed plaintiffs suit. Judgment of First Appellate Court
dismissing plaintiffs suit was based on mis-leading and mis-construction of
oral and documentary evidence, placed on record and the same was not
sustainable in the eye of law. Defendants, title having become clear on
11.4.1984 on basis of decision of litigation going on relating to property in
question, suit filed on 27.3.1985 was well within time. Judgment and decree
passed by First Appellate Court dismissing plaintiffs sent was set aside while
that of Trial Court decreeing plaintiffs suit was restored in circumstances.<b>&nbsp;
P.L.J.1999Lah. 1795</b>. Suit for specific performance of agreement to sell
decreed by Trial Court and the High Court. Concurrent finding of fact could not
be interfered with by S.C.in appeal in as much as such finding did not suffer
from any misreading of evidence or non-consideration of relevant pieces of
evidence on record. Such finding being one of fact and based on evidence was
un-exceptionable. Execution of agreement of sale having been admitted burden of
proving that the same was void or invalid was entirely on appellants which they
failed to discharge. Material on record clearly indicated that resolution of
general body of appellants of specified date relating to sale of property in
question, was passed validly, therefore, decrees of Courts below including the
High Court on such question of fact being valid were maintained in
circumstances<b>.&nbsp; P.L.J.2000 SC 1708 = 2000 SCMR 506. </b></p>

between the parties was not a simple agreement in nature of sale purchase of
immovable property, rather it was for development of the suit sales, though
within a Specified period as stipulated in the agreement--- Trial Court granted
interim injunction with a condition to deposit the balance consideration
amount--- Validity - Not rule of law that essentially in all the cases of
specific performance, while granting temporary injunction to the plaintiff, the
Court should impose condition to deposit of balance consideration--- Imposing
of such condition depended upon facts and circumstances of the case enabling
the court to exercise its discretionary equitable relief - As the defendants
prima facie were found at fault in not handing over the entire suit land to the
plaintiffs for the purpose of such development, imposition of condition for the
deposit of the balance consideration in the facts and circumstances of the
case, would be harsh and against the settled rules for the exercise of
discretion - Plaintiffs had established existence of prima facie case in their
favour, for it was they who were to suffer irreparable loss in case temporary
injection was not issued and the condition of deposit of the remaining amount
of consideration was not legally justified - present agreement being not in the
nature of direct sale but an agreement for development of the land into plots
and thereafter sale of the developed plots and payment of the amount of
consideration from the sale proceeds, therefore, the order of deposit of Rs. 42
crores amounted to denial of the relief of temporary injunction to which the

refunded earnest money) on their own filed amended plaint transposing
themselves as plaintiffs seeking relief of mandatory injunction against
defendant having refunded earnest money - Validity -&nbsp; Entirely new facts
had been pleaded in amended plaint, wherein relief was claimed only, against
one defendant, who had refunded earnest money - Complexion, character and
nature of the suit of specific performance and injunction had been changed to
that of mandatory injunction - Right or interest available to original
plaintiff/vendee had not been acquired by said defendants - Rather said rights
and interest had been assumed and acquired by defendant, who while refunding
earnest money to original plaintiff had undertaken to buy suit property either
by himself or through his nominee - Defendant by doing so had stepped into the
shoes of original plaintiff, thus, Court transposed him as plaintiff being
vendee - Such transposition would not change character, complexion or nature of
the suit for specific performance - Amended plaint filed by some defendant was
rejected in circumstance. In amended plaint, pleadings in suit for specific
performance were no more there, instead entirely new facts were pleaded, relief
was directed against one defendant only. Complexion, character and nature of
the suit for specific performance and injunction had been changed to that of
mandatory injunction seeking implementation of orders passed in the suit. Had
there been any claim/suit in respect of administration, partition and
distribution of the estate of deceased pending inter se the parties, then of
course transposition of some of the defendants as plaintiff in the matter could
have been possible. There was no order for the transposition of other
defendants as plaintiffs. Contention of said other defendants that when Court
granted two weeks further time to file amended plaint, in fact it allowed
transposition of parties could not be sustained for the reasons, firstly there
was no earlier direction of filing amended plaint or order for transposition of
parties; secondly even if it was presumed that by granting time to file amended
plaint, transposition of parties was allowed, then there was nothing on record,
whereby transposed parties were allowed to amend the pleadings to an extent
that entire complexion, nature and character of suit was changed. Amended
plaint filed by said defendants transposing themselves as plaintiff was
rejected. Transposition of parties could be ordered by the Court both on
application of any party or suo motu in case where Court was satisfied that any
party to a proceedings had stepped into the shoes of another or interest of any
party to the proceedings had either been acquired, transferred, assumed by way
of assignment, devolution, transfer in any lawful manner only then
transposition of such party could be ordered to avoid multiplicity of the
proceedings to cut short the litigation provided nature, character and
completion of suit was not changed. Defendants had not acquired any right or
interest as vendee in the suit property which were available to original
plaintiff/vendee. Rights and interest as vendee of the suit property were
assumed and acquired by the other defendant who in fact while refunding the
earnest money to original plaintiff undertook to buy the subject property
either himself or through his nominee. By doing so in fact he had stepped into
the shoes of original vendee/plaintiff. If any person was to be transposed, it
was the defendant who could be transposed as plaintiff being vendee. By
ordering transposition of said defendant as plaintiff, neither the character,
complexion nor nature of the suit for specific performance would be changed.
Under the circumstances, defendant was ordered to be transposed as plaintiff,
name of original plaintiff was struck off and rest of the defendants were to
remain defendants. </span><span lang=EN-GB style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>PLD

</span><b>Sale of Joint Hindu property</b>:-- Hindu Law defines ingredients of
legal necessity on basis of which Karta can dispose of Joint family property
while S. 244, Hindu law makes purchaser of Joint family property liable to
prove that either there was legal necessity in fact and that he made proper and
bona fide enquiry as to the existence of such necessity and did all that was
reasonable to satisfy himself as to the existence of necessity. Appellate Court
erred in law in holding that plaintiffs were under burden to prove that
defendant, had not fulfilled conditions of legal necessity before purchase of
property in question, as contemplated by S. 243 of Hindu Law. Such finding was
contrary to law as provisions of S. 244 of Hindu law are very clear whereunder
purchaser was under burden to prove that he was satisfied with requirements of
S. 243 of Hindu law before entering into transaction with Manager/Karta of
Joint family property. Appellate Courts view that burden shifted to plaintiffs
was not in accordance with law. Trial Court on basis of material on record had
rightly concluded that defendants had failed to discharge their burden to
satisfy requirements of Sections 243 and 244 of Hindu law. Appellate Court
thus, mis-applied, mis-interpreted law and based its Judgment on misreading of
evidence, therefore, Judgment of Appellate Court was set aside, while Judgment

see the identity cards of all the executants, because all of them did not
possess those cards, only three had the identity cards that he did not go to

identified the plaintiffs at the time of proceedings before the local

for seeking comparison of the thumb-impressions or signatures of the plaintiffs
through any Handwriting Expert/Fingerprint Expert, thus on the basis of such
evidence, the view of the Appellate court that the power of attorney had been
duly proved was the result of sheer misreading and non-reading of the record,
resultantly the same was set aside by the High Court in revision. <b>PLD 2003

disputed property was ever acquired by Irrigation Department as per its claim
why it was not incorporated in Rev. record and if it was so in corporated why
relevant record was not produced in Court. Analysis of evidence produced by
plaintiffs inspired confidence, which would lead to irritable conclusion that
plaintiffs were owners of land in question. Demarcation proceedings were
carried out three times in presence of senior officers of Irrigation
Department, whereto no objection was raised by representatives of Irrigation
Department to demarcation proceedings, rather they agreed to correctness of
those proceedings and put there signatures under that report which was duly

Plot in question, was cancelled from the name of appellant and was allotted in

to get his title established or for redressal of his grievances but kept on
waiting for the result of litigation by respondents, thereby ignoring the fact
that he could not derive any benefit, in as much as, he was having no legal

respondent had got executed such document for consideration of specified amount
out of which he had paid more than half of such specified price. Courts below
had found that amendment sought to be introduced would change complexion of
suit and would also change its cause of action. Perusal of contents of plaint

plaintiff was seeking to introduce by way of amendment were tantamount to
introduce altogether a different case from the one which he had originally set

parties kept seeking adjournment from 10.12.1996 to 10.6.1997 as talks of

by them. Thus such compromise entered into by counsel on behalf of party would
bind such party. Section 115 C.P.C. applies to cases, involving illegal
assumption, non exercise or irregular exercise of Jurisdiction. Neither any
such aspect has been put forth or highlighted, nor is seemingly available so as

comply with provision of O.XLI, R. 31 C.P.C. was without force, therefore, the
same could not warrant interference of High Court. Appellate Court while
upholding trial Courts -findings considered evidence issue-wise. Petitioner,
thus, could not point out any Jurisdictional defect in impugned Judgment nor-he
could show any misreading of relevant evidence or overlooking of any important
evidence. Ownership of disputed property being involved in the case, evidence
had been evaluated by both Courts below. Dispute relating to ownership of
property in question, was question of fact and the same was determinable on
thorough analysis of evidence led by parties. Evidence on record having been
evaluated by Appellate Court, Scope of revisional Jurisdiction was limited and
no interference was Justified unless patent illegality, want of Jurisdiction,
mis-exercise of authority or material irregularity could be disclosed.

Suit challenging gift executed by his mother in respect of her entire land in
favour of defendant (her nephew) on the ground of fraud and misrepresentation
contending that she being a Pardanashin lady could not manage her land, but
defendant was managing her land and he got a gift document executed in his
favour pretending the same to be a document for management of land - Trial
Court as well as Appellate Court dismissed the suit, but High Court in second
appeal decreed the suit - Validity - Undisputed position emerging from
statements of witnesses was that disputed land was located in the village,
where defendant was residing and donor was not residing; that disputed land was
being looked after by defendant, who had obtained the same on contract (Theka)
from donor; that defendant after institution of suit had made serious attempts
to get the matter compromised and offered one Murabba of land for withdrawal of
suit; and that negotiation for compromise had taken place in presence of named
persons - All said witness had supported each other on all material points and
they stood firm to the test of cross-examination and nothing beneficial could
be extracted from them - Even a remote suggestion had not been made to said
witnesses that defendant as donee was owner of the land - No legal
Justification existed to discard such evidence - Though evidence of said
witnesses could not be discussed by High Court at length, but the same would
have no substantial bearing on merits of the case as the conclusion derived by
means of impugned Judgment was free from any infirmity - Statement of defendants
witness that gift deed had been executed at the behest of mother of plaintiff
with the consent of plaintiff was not believable as no sourceless person like
the plaintiff would give his consent to his mother for donating entire land in
favour of her nephew (defendant) - Had consent of plaintiff been obtained, then
he would have signed the gift deed, which would have been a solid proof for its
execution, genuineness and authenticity whereof could not be challenged - If
gift was executed with consent of plaintiff, then what had prompted him to file
the suit, which was indicative of the fact that plaintiff was not aware about
the gift-deed and was not a consenting party - Mother (donor) could not have
deprived the plaintiff (her son), when there was nothing on record to show that
they were not on good terms or plaintiff was disobedient - Contents of
gift-deed had never been read to executants thereof - Gift-deed was not valid
one and its authenticity was not above board - Dishonest omissions in statement
of defendants witness, also appeared to be self-contradictory - In view of
defendants assertion that disputed land had been transferred by means of a
valid gift, there was absolutely no lawful Justification to take the plea of
adverse possession and the only irresistible conclusion of which would be that
no such gift-deed had ever been executed - Neither any gift-deed whatsoever had
been executed by mother of plaintiff nor conscious and unequivocal possession
of land had been handed over to defendant as he could not adduce any convincing
evidence in that regard -&nbsp; Defendant had failed to prove the execution of
gift-deed by producing credible evidence - Trial Court and Appellate Court had
failed to examine the evidence on record in its true perspective - </span><span

challenged gift executed by his mother in respect of her entire land in favour

defendant was managing her land and he got a gift document executed in his
favour pretending the same to be a document for management of land - Trial
Court as well as Appellate Court dismissed the suit, but High Court in second
appeal decreed the suit - Validity - Undisputed position emerging from
statements of witnesses was that disputed land was located in the village,
where defendant was residing and donor was not residing; that disputed land was
being looked after by defendant, who had obtained the same on contract (Theka)
from donor; that defendant after institution of suit had made serious attempts
to get the matter compromised and offered one Murabba of land for withdrawal of
suit; and that negotiation for compromise had taken place in presence of named
persons - All said witness had supported each other on all material points and
they stood firm to the test of cross-examination and nothing beneficial could
be extracted from them - Even a remote suggestion had not been made to said
witnesses that defendant as donee was owner of the land - No legal
Justification existed to discard such evidence - Though evidence of said witnesses
could not be discussed by High Court at length, but the same would have no
substantial bearing on merits of the case as the conclusion derived by means of
impugned Judgment was free from any infirmity - Statement of defendants
witness that gift deed had been executed at the behest of mother of plaintiff
with the consent of plaintiff was not believable as no sourceless person like
the plaintiff would give his consent to his mother for donating entire land in
favour of her nephew (defendant) - Had consent of plaintiff been obtained, then
he would have signed the gift deed, which would have been a solid proof for its
execution, genuineness and authenticity whereof could not be challenged - If
gift was executed with consent of plaintiff, then what had prompted him to file
the suit, which was indicative of the fact that plaintiff was not aware about
the gift-deed and was not a consenting party - Mother (donor) could not have
deprived the plaintiff (her son), when there was nothing on record to show that
they were not on good terms or plaintiff was disobedient - Contents of
gift-deed had never been read to executants thereof - Gift-deed was not valid
one and its authenticity was not above board - Dishonest omissions in statement
of defendants witness, also appeared to be self-contradictory - In view of
defendants assertion that disputed land had been transferred by means of a
valid gift, there was absolutely no lawful Justification to take the plea of
adverse possession and the only irresistible conclusion of which would be that
no such gift-deed had ever been executed - Neither any gift-deed whatsoever had
been executed by mother of plaintiff nor conscious and unequivocal possession
of land had been handed over to defendant as he could not adduce any convincing
evidence in that regard -&nbsp; Defendant had failed to prove the execution of
gift-deed by producing credible evidence - Trial Court and Appellate Court had
failed to examine the evidence on record in its true perspective - S.C

had not been acquired by said defendants - Rather said rights and interest had
been assumed and acquired by defendant, who while refunding earnest money to
original plaintiff had undertaken to buy suit property either by himself or

original plaintiff, thus, Court transposed him as plaintiff being vendee - Such
transposition would not change character, complexion or nature of the suit for
specific performance - Amended plaint filed by some defendant was rejected in
circumstance. In amended plaint, pleadings in suit for specific performance
were no more there, instead entirely new facts were pleaded, relief was
directed against one defendant only. Complexion, character and nature of the
suit for specific performance and injunction had been changed to that of
mandatory injunction seeking implementation of orders passed in the suit. Had
there been any claim/suit in respect of administration, partition and
distribution of the estate of deceased pending inter se the parties, then of
course transposition of some of the defendants as plaintiff in the matter could
have been possible. There was no order for the transposition of other
defendants as plaintiffs. Contention of said other defendants that when Court
granted two weeks further time to file amended plaint, in fact it allowed
transposition of parties could not be sustained for the reasons, firstly there
was no earlier direction of filing amended plaint or order for transposition of
parties; secondly even if it was presumed that by granting time to file amended
plaint, transposition of parties was allowed, then there was nothing on record,
whereby transposed parties were allowed to amend the pleadings to an extent
that entire complexion, nature and character of suit was changed. Amended
plaint filed by said defendants transposing themselves as plaintiff was
rejected. Transposition of parties could be ordered by the Court both on
application of any party or suo motu in case where Court was satisfied that any
party to a proceedings had stepped into the shoes of another or interest of any
party to the proceedings had either been acquired, transferred, assumed by way
of assignment, devolution, transfer in any lawful manner only then
transposition of such party could be ordered to avoid multiplicity of the
proceedings to cut short the litigation provided nature, character and
completion of suit was not changed. Defendants had not acquired any right or
interest as vendee in the suit property which were available to original
plaintiff/vendee. Rights and interest as vendee of the suit property were
assumed and acquired by the other defendant who in fact while refunding the
earnest money to original plaintiff undertook to buy the subject property
either himself or through his nominee. By doing so in fact he had stepped into
the shoes of original vendee/plaintiff. If any person was to be transposed, it
was the defendant who could be transposed as plaintiff being vendee. By
ordering transposition of said defendant as plaintiff, neither the character,
complexion nor nature of the suit for specific performance would be changed.
Under the circumstances, defendant was ordered to be transposed as plaintiff,
name of original plaintiff was struck off and rest of the defendants were to

<b>Unchallenged evidence</b>:--Courts below had committed a grave legal error
by overlooking the admitted position that evidence of plaintiff and his
witnesses had gone unchallenged thus, in law the facts stated by them had to be
taken as admitted by defendants - Cross-examination of plaintiff was reserved
at the request of defendants Advocate, but they remained absent on the
relevant date - Defendants apparently had chosen not to cross-examine plaintiff
- Plaintiff while producing his documentary evidence had adopted his earlier
deposition on record, which covered all material points of fact, but defendants
did not opt to cross-examine him then - Alleged agreement to sell on the basis
of which defendants claimed to have purchased disputed plot from plaintiff
could not come on record - Courts below had put entire burden on plaintiff to
prove alleged agreement to sell to be a forged document - Courts below had
fallen into a grave mistake in overlooking the admitted fact that plaintiffs
oral evidence had gone unchallenged as he was not cross-examined by defendants
- Resultantly, plaintiffs version that such was not a sale agreement, but was
a document executed in token of loan obtained by him from
predecessor-in-interest of defendants on the condition that in case of
non-payment, the amount would be adjusted towards rent payable by defendant in
respect of disputed plot rented out to him, stood accepted for all practical
purposes - Defendants had failed to prove the existence of alleged agreement to
sell - Alleged agreement to sell was not a registered document and was not
adequate by itself to confer a title upon defendants - No evidence on record to
rebut such evidence of plaintiff beyond the averments in written statement,
which alone were not rebuttal of plaintiffs evidence - Documentary evidence of
plaintiff had been rejected as being managed documents without assigning any
Justifiable reason therefor - Concurrent findings of Courts below were
manifestly perverse, suffering from non-reading of evidence on material points
and flagrant misreading of evidence on record - High Court was Justified in
such circumstances to interfere with concurrent findings in exercise of
Jurisdiction under S.115, C.P.C.&nbsp; - High Court set aside impugned
