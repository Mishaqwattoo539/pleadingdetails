of the Antidumping Duties Ordinances, 2000 (the Ordinance) after establishing
that the application lodged by wah Nobel acetates Ltd., G.T. Road, Wah Cantt.

sections 20 and 24 of the Ordinance, The subject matter and this investigation
concerns dumping of GAA, being Glacial Acetic Acid minimum concentration 99%
originating in and exported from Chinese Taipei (Taiwan) to Pakistan. In
accordance with the Ordinance and the Anti-Dumping Duties Rules, 2001 (the

Adjustments in normal value claimed by the Exporter on account of credit cost
and discount were taken into account; the inland freight was also deducted from
the sales price to yield ex-factory normal value. The preliminary weighted
average adjusted normal value of the investigated product imported during the
POI thus works out to be US$ 503.70/MT.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-align:justify'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

(a) indenters commission (b) credit cost (C) bank charges (d) ocean freight
(e) inland freight (f) harbour construction tax (g) trade promotion fee, and
(h) customs brokerage fee. The preliminary weighted average adjusted ex-factory

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-align:justify'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<b>Dumping Margin</b> The dumping margin has been calculated in accordance with
Section 12(1) of the Ordinance by comparing the weighted average adjusted
ex-factory normal value with the weighted average adjusted ex-factory export
price. The provisional dumping margin expressed as a percentage of weighted
average C&amp;F export price thus works out to be 13.77%. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-align:justify'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<b>Injury to the Domestic Industry</b> Injury to the domestic industry has been
determined in accordance with Part VI of the Ordinance. The Commission has on
preliminary basis established that the domestic industry was and is being
materially injured on account of; price undercutting, price depression, price
suppression, decline in production and capacity utilization, decline in market
share and sales, decline in return on investment, decline in productivity, incurrence
of losses on its operations, negative effect on inventories, negative effect on
growth and investment, negative effect on cash flow, and a significant
magnitude of dumping margin. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-align:justify'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<b>Dumped Imports</b> Volume of dumped imports increased annually by 50.5% and
59.64% in the FY 2001-02 and FY 2002-03, respectively. The production of the
domestic like product increased by 19.83% in the FY 2001-02 over FY 2000-01 and
it decreased by 3.81% in the FY 2002-03 over FY 2001-02. Based on these facts, the
Commission has concluded that the dumped imports increased in absolute as well
as relative terms compared with the production of domestic like product. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-align:justify'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<b>Injury Factors Other than Dumped Imports</b> The Commission also examined
factors other than dumped imports, which were causing injury to the domestic
industry. These include imports from countries other than <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Taiwan</st1:country-region></st1:place>, and interest rates
prevailing in the country at the time of installation of domestic industry.
However, the share of these factors in overall material injury is comparatively
small and has been excluded in calculating injury due to dumped imports. </p>

<b>Imposition of Provisional Antidumping Duty</b> In reaching this preliminary
affirmative determination, the Commission is satisfied that the investigated
product has been imported at dumped prices. This has caused material injury to
domestic industry during the POI. In order to prevent material injury in course
of this investigation, the commission, pursuant to the powers conferred upon it
under Section 43 of the Ordinance, has decided to impose a provisional
antidumping duty @ 13.77% ad Val&nbsp; of C&amp;F price on import of GAA,
importable from the Exporter, fro a period of four months effective from
February 25, 2004. the provisional antidumping duty shall take the form of
security by way of cash deposit in commissions Non-lapsable PLD Account No.

would be collected in the same manner as customs duty is collected under the
Customs Act, 1969 (IV of 1969). </p>
