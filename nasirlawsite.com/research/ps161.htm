<p style='text-align:justify'>V. Ramaswami, C.J.</p>

<p style='text-align:justify'>1. In this case the petitioner. Dulichand Khirwal,
seeks a writ in the nature of certiorari from the High Court for the purpose of
calling up and quashing the order of the Commissioner of Chota Nagpur, dated
11-2-1956, in Kolhan Title Appeal No. 124 of 1954.</p>

<p style='text-align:justify'>2. The petitioner was a lessee for a period of
five years from the State Government with regard to 42 acres of land in village
Kusmunda, Police Station Chaibasa, in the Kolhan area. The said lease was for
working a quarry for China clay in the said area. The rental fixed for working
of the quarry was Rs. 125/- per year. Respondent No. 1, the State of <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:State w:st="on">Bihar</st1:State></st1:place>, filed Kolhan Suit
No. 31 of 1952, against the petitioner for recovery of a sum of Rs. 2,250/- on
account of the minimum royalty due for the period from 21-5-1945 to 20-5-1950.</p>

<p style='text-align:justify'>The suit was filed in the court of the Additional
Deputy Commissioner of Singhbhum, who dismissed the suit on merits on 9-4-1954.
The State of <st1:State w:st="on">Bihar</st1:State> thereafter took an appeal
before the Commissioner of Chota Nagpur Division, who heard the appeal on
merits and allowed the appeal, holding that the State of <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:State
 w:st="on">Bihar</st1:State></st1:place> was entitled to get a decree against
the defendant for the recovery of the amount claimed.</p>

<p style='text-align:justify'>3. The first ground taken by learned Counsel on
behalf of the petitioner is that the Deputy Commissioner of Singhbhum adopted a
procedure prescribed by Wilkinson's Rules which are no longer in force and so
the Commissioner of Chota Nagpur had no jurisdiction to hear the appeal. In
support of this argument reference was made to a judgment of this Court in K.K.
Sinha v. Basudeo Harjiwan Pathak, Misc. Judl. Case No. 392 of 1952, D/-
22-12-1952 (A) where it was held that Act II of 1951, amended the Civil
Procedure Code so as to extend its operation to the whole of India, including
the so-called scheduled districts, with the exception of certain Tribal Areas
in the State of Assam, in the State of Madras and in the State of Jammu and
Kashmir and the State of Manipur. Act II of 1951, received the assent of the
President on 17-2-1951, and came into effect from that date, and so it was held
by the High Court in that case that the Civil Procedure Code applied to the
entire district of Singhbhum, including the scheduled area of Kolhan.</p>

<p style='text-align:justify'>But on behalf of the State of Bihar it was
pointed out by learned Counsel that the effect of this judgment has been
superseded by a subsequent notification of the State Government, dated
26-8-1953, issued in exercise of the authority conferred on the State
Government by sub-paragraph (1) of paragraph 5' of the Fifth schedule to the
Constitution of India. The notification of the State Government is in the
following terms.</p>

<p style='text-align:justify'>&quot;No. A/AB/303/53-3533J. ':-- In exercise of
the powers conferred by sub-paragraph (1) of paragraph 5 of the Fifth Schedule
to the Constitution of India, the Governor of Bihar is pleased to direct that
the Code of Civil Procedure (Amendment) Act, 1951 (II of 1951), shall not apply
to the Sadar Subdivision of the district of Singhbhum except the areas
comprised within the Chaibassa and Chakradharpur Municipalities.</p>

<p style='text-align:justify'>2. This notification shall be deemed to have come
into force on the 1st April, 1951, the date on which the said Act was brought
into force by the Central Government.</p>

<p style='text-align:justify'>By order of the Governor of Bihar,</p>

<p style='text-align:justify'>R. Singh, Secy.&quot;</p>

<p style='text-align:justify'>In view of this Government notification I do not
think that the ratio of the decision in Misc. Judl. Case No. 392 of 1952, D/-
22-12-1952 (Pat) (A) has any application to the present case and the argument
of learned Counsel on this point must fail.</p>

<p style='text-align:justify'>4. It was then submitted on behalf of the
petitioner that Regulation XIII of 1833, under 1 which the Agent to the
Governor General made Wilkinson's Rules, has been repealed by Act XII of 1876
and, therefore, Wilkinson's Rules do not exist any longer as they have been
automatically repealed with the repeal of Regulation XIII of 1833. I do not
think that this argument is correct, because Section 7 of Act XIV of 1874, has
the legal effect of continuing the life of Wilkinson's Rules. Section 7 of Act
XIV of 1874, States as follows :--</p>

<p style='text-align:justify'>&quot;7. All rules heretofore prescribed by the
Governor-General in Council or the Local Government for the guidance of
officers appointed within any of the Scheduled Districts for all or any of the
purposes mentioned in Section 6 and in force at the time of the passing of this
Act, shall continue to be in force unless and until the Governor General in
Council or the Local Government, as the case may be, otherwise directs.</p>

<p style='text-align:justify'>All existing officers so appointed previous to
the date on which this Act comes into force in such District, shall be deemed
to have been appointed hereunder.&quot;</p>

<p style='text-align:justify'>It was urged on behalf of the petitioner that
Section 7 does not apply to this case because there is no proof that
Wilkinson's. Rules were &quot;prescribed by the Governor-General in Council for
the guidance of officers appointed within any of the Scheduled Districts&quot;
within the meaning of Section 7 of Act XIV of 1874. Going back to the
Provisions of Regulation XIII of 1833, we find that the authority to prescribe
rules has been granted to the Governor-General under section V of the Regulation,
which runs as follows :--</p>

<p style='text-align:justify'>&quot;V. It shall be competent to the
Governor-General, by an Order in Council, to prescribe such rules as he may
deem proper for the guidance of the agent and all the officers subordinate to
his control and authority to determine what powers shall be exercised by the
agent and his assistants respectively; also to determine to what extent the
decision of the agent in civil suits shall be final, and in what suits an
appeal shall lie to the Sudder Dewanny Adawlat, and to define the authority to
be exercised by the agent in criminal trials, and what cases he shall submit
for the decision of the Nizamut Adawlut.&quot;</p>

<p style='text-align:justify'>Section IV of this Regulation is also important
and must be reproduced in full :--</p>

<p style='text-align:justify'>&quot;IV. The administration of civil and
criminal justice, the collection of revenue, the superintendence of the police,
of the land revenue, customs, abkaree, stamps, and every branch of Government
within the tracts of country separated as prescribed in the foregoing section,
shall be vested in an officer appointed by the Governor-General in Council, to
be denominated agent to the Governor-General.&quot;</p>

<p style='text-align:justify'>The argument on behalf of the petitioner is that
Wilkinson's Rules were framed under Section IV of Regulation XIII of 1833, and
not under section V by the Governor-General by an Order in Council, But no
material has been produced on behalf of the petitioner to show that the rules
were not framed by the Governor-General under S. V of Regulation XIII of 1833.</p>

<p style='text-align:justify'>It is true that the typed copy of Wilkinson's
Rules produced by the parties before us has been signed by Mr. Wilkinson as
&quot;Governor-General's Agent.&quot; But the first paragraph of the typed copy
shows that the rules have been framed &quot;for the administration of Civil
Justice within the jurisdiction of the Agent to the Governor-General under
Regulation XIII of 1833.&quot; It is, therefore, not possible to say from the
typed copy of the rules whether the Governor-General has prescribed them by an
Order in Council or whether Mr. Wilkinson himself made the rules under the
authority granted to him by Section IV of the Regulation.</p>

<p style='text-align:justify'>But it is the undisputed position that
Wilkinson's Rules have been accepted as valid law and acted upon by the
Government Officers and the people of Kolhan area for several decades.
Decisions have been given, titles to property have passed and contracts have
been made on the basis that Wilkinson's Rules continue to exist in Kolhan area,
it is important to notice that the Kolhan Inquiry Committee appointed by the
State Government in 1948, has said in Chapter II of its report that civil
justice is still administered under Wilkinson's Rules and that these rules are
statutory rules framed under Regulation XIII of 1833, and are still in force by
virtue of Section 7 of the Scheduled Districts Act. It was stated by learned
Counsel on behalf of the opposite party that the order in Council by which the
Governor-General prescribed the rules is not traceable.</p>

<p style='text-align:justify'>But in a case of this description, I think that
the maxim omina pracsumuntur rite et solenniter esse acta donee probetur in
contrarium is applicable. There is a striking illustration of this principle in
Queen v. Powell, (1854) 118 E. R. 1183 (B) in which a Bye-law of a Corporation
was presumed to exist from long usage, and in Williams v. Eyton, (1858) 157 E.
R., 318 at p. 320 (C) where the presumption was made from usage that there was
a statutory order of two justices under section 8 of the General Enclosure Act.
The presumption was also applied by the Full Bench of the Allahabad High Court
in Queen-Empress v. Ganga Ram, ILR 18 All. 136 (D) in which a question arose as
to the validity of the appointment of Mr. Justice Burkitt, of the Allahabad
High Court under the provisions of Sections 7 and 16 of the Statute 24 and 25
Vic., Cap, 104.</p>

<p style='text-align:justify'>It was held by the learned Judges constituting
the Pull Bench that the presumption, must be drawn that Mr. Justice Burkitt was
lawfully appointed from the fact that he was actually functioning as a Judge of
the High Court since November, 1892. The gravity of the question was apparent
because if Mr. Justice Burkitt Was not legally appointed, all his judgments,
decrees and orders in Civil and Criminal cases would have been ultra vires and
illegal.</p>

<p style='text-align:justify'>It was, therefore, held by the Pull Bench that it
must be presumed that the appointment was legally made in the exercise of some
power unknown to the Court vested in the Secretary of State for India. In view
of the principle laid down in the above-mentioned cases we must presume in the
present case that Wilkinson's Rules were prescribed by the Governor-General by
an order in Council under section V of Regulation XIII of 1833, and that these
rules have been continued by Act XIV of 1874, and succeeding statutes. I,
therefore, reject the contention of Mr. Untwalia on this point.</p>

<p style='text-align:justify'>5. It was argued by learned Counsel on behalf of
the petitioner that even if Wilkinson's Rules were made under Section V of
Regulation XIII of 1833, by the Governor-General by an order in Council,
nevertheless the passing of Act I of 1903, put an end to the life of these rules.
Learned Counsel conceded that Section 7 of Act XIV of 1874, contained a saving
clause. It was also conceded by learned Counsel for the petitioner that Act XII
of 1891, also contained a saving clause. Section 3 of this Act is in the
following terms ;--</p>

<p style='text-align:justify'>&quot;3. The repeal by this Act of any enactment
shall not affect any Statute, Act or Regulation in which such enactment has
been applied incorporated or referred to;</p>

<p style='text-align:justify'>and this Act shall not affect the validity,
invalidity, effect or consequences of anything already done or suffered, or any
right, title, obligation or liability already acquired, accrued or incurred, or
any remedy or proceeding in respect thereof, or any release or discharge of or
from any debt, penalty, obligation, liability, claim or demand, or any
indemnity already granted, or the proof of any past act or thing;</p>

<p style='text-align:justify'>Nor shall this Act affect any principle or rule
of law, or established jurisdiction, form or course of pleading, practice or
procedure, or existing usage, custom, privilege, restriction, exemption, office
or appointment, notwithstanding that the same respectively may have been in any
manner affirmed, recognised or derived by, in or from any enactment hereby
repealed;</p>

<p style='text-align:justify'>nor shall the repeal by this Act of any enactment
provide or restore any jurisdiction, office, custom, liability, right, title,
privilege, restriction exemption, usage, practice, procedure or other matter or
thing not now existing or in force.&quot;</p>

<p style='text-align:justify'>But it was pointed out by the learned Counsel
that Act I of 1903, repealed Act XII of 1891, including section 3 and the
Schedules, and subsequent passing of amending Act X of 1914, did not have the
effect of reviving the saving clause. I do not wish to pronounce any concluded
opinion on this point. Assuming that the argument of the learned Counsel is
right, the fact remains that Wilkinson's rules have been accepted as valid law
and acted upon by the Government Officers and the people of Kolhan area for
several decades, even after the passing of Act I of 1903. I have already
referred to the Kolhan Inquiry Committee appointed by the Stats Government in
1848, which states in Chapter II of its report that Civil Justice is still
administered in the area under Wilkinson's Rule. It is menifest that for a long
period of time suits have been fought, decisions have been given, titles to
property have passed and contracts have been made on the basis that Wilkinson's
Rules continue to validly exist in the Kolhan area. In my opinion, the
principle of the maxim communis error facit jus should be applied to this case.
The principle underlying the maxim is that &quot;the law so favours the public
good, that it will in some cases permit a common error to pass for right;&quot;
as an instance of which may be mentioned the case of common recoveries in
English law, which were fictitious proceedings introduced by a kind, of pia
fraus to clued the statute de Donis and which were at length allowed by the
courts to be a bar to an estate tail, so that these recoveries however
clandestinely introduced, became by long use and acquiescence a legal mode of
conveyance whereby a tenant in tail might dispose of his lands.</p>

<p style='text-align:justify'>There is a reference made to this principle by
lord <st1:place w:st="on">Blackburn</st1:place> in his speech in Dayidson v.
Sir R. C. Sinclair, (1878) 3 A. C. 765 at pp. 787-88 (E) as follows :--</p>

<p style='text-align:justify'>&quot;The silence of the Judges on this point is
accounted for from their thinking that the point had been concluded by
authority since the decision of Weatherstone v. Marquis of Tweeddale (12 Shaw
1) (F) now forty-five years ago and assuming (perhaps from the point not being
pressed before them) that this was now generally agreed by the practitioners in
Scotland that it was unnecessary to say anything about it. My Lords, I need
hardly say that the opinion of the profession, on any matter of every-day
occurrence on which they are continually asked to advise, is a very weighty
authority. A court of appeal should be cautious before determining that a
decision frequently considered and always acquiesced in, was wrong.</p>

<p style='text-align:justify'>And if from the time which has elapsed and the
nature of the point (as, for instance, a point in convincing law), there is
reason to believe that rights have been regulated and arrangements as to
property made on the basis of the decision, it may be right to uphold it, even
though convinced that it was originally wrong. In such cases the maxim
'communis error facit jus' applies.&quot;</p>

<p style='text-align:justify'>In a subsequent case Charles Dalton v. Henry
Angus and Co. (1881) 6 A. C. 740 at p. 812 (G) Lord Blackburn states :</p>

<p style='text-align:justify'>&quot;I quite agree with what is said by the late
Chief Justice Cockburn in Angus v. Dalton, (1878) S QBD 85 at p. 105 (H), that
where the evidence proved an adverse enjoyment as of right for twenty years, or
little more, and' nothing else, 'no one had the faintest belief that any grant
had ever existed and the presumption was known to be a mere fiction'.</p>

<p style='text-align:justify'>He thinks that thus to shorten the period of
prescription without the authority of the Legislature was a great judicial
usurpation. Perhaps it was. The same thing may be said of all legal fictions,
and was often said (with, I think, more reason) of recoveries. But I take it
that when a long series of cases have settled the law, it would produce
intolerable confusion if it were to be reversed because the mode in which it
was introduced was not approved of; even where it was originally a blunder and
inconvenient, communis error facit jus. But to refuse to administer a
long-established law because it was based on a fiction of law, admitted to be
for a purpose and producing a result very beneficial, is as it seems to me at
least as great a usurpation of what is property the function of the legislature
as it was at first to introduce that fiction.&quot;</p>

<p style='text-align:justify'>In my opinion, therefore, the principle of the
maxim communis error facit jus applies to the facts of the present case and the
argument of learned counsel for the petitioner must be rejected.</p>

<p style='text-align:justify'>6. It was then argued on behalf of the petitioner
that the suit was instituted in the year 1952, and the Civil Procedure Code was
then applicable, and, therefore, it was incumbent upon the Deputy Commissioner
to try the suit in accordance with the Civil Procedure Code and no appeal was
competent before the Commissioner of Chotanagpur Division. I do not accept this
argument as correct, because the notification of the State Government dated
26-8-1953, expressly makes it retrospective. Paragraph 2 of the Notification
states that it shall be deemed to have come into force on 1-4-1951 the date on
which the Code of Civil Procedure (Amendment) Act, 1951 (Act II of 1951) was
brought into force by the Central Government.&quot;</p>

<p style='text-align:justify'>It is clear, therefore, that by a legislative
fiction the notification should be treated as having come into force on the
date when the suit against the petitioner was filed. In my opinion, effect must
be given to this legislative fiction created by the government notification
dated 26-8-1953, issued in exercise of the authority conferred by sub-para (1)
of Paragraph 5 of the Fifth Schedule to the Constitution of India and it must
be deemed that the Code of Civil Procedure (Amendment) Act, 1951 (Act II of
1951) was not effective in Kolhan area on the date when the suit against the
petitioner was filed. If that is the correct view of the law, it follows that
the Deputy Commissioner of singhbhum was right in treating the suit as a Kolhan
suit and the Commissioner of Chotanagpur Division had jurisdiction to hear and
determine the appeal as a Kolhan appeal.</p>

<p style='text-align:justify'>7. The question as to how far the legislative
fiction has to be carried is a question which depends upon the construction of
the particular statute or particular notification. If the notification enacts
that something shall be deemed to have been done, which in truth and fact was
not done, the court is entitled as a matter of construction of the notification
to determine and ascertain for what purpose and between what persons the
fiction has to be applied and full effect has to be given to that fiction and
it should be carried to its logical limits.</p>

<p style='text-align:justify'>That is the principle laid down by the Supreme
Court in <a href="http://www.indiankanoon.org/doc/379047/">State of Bombay v.
Pandurang Vinayak,</a> 1953 SCR 773: (AIR 1953 SC 244) (I). The matter has also
been put very clearly by Lord Asquith in East End Dwellings Co. Ltd. v.
Pinsbury Borough Council, 1952 AC 109 (J). The question at issue in that case was
the proper interpretation to be placed on S. 53 (a) of the Town and Country
Planning Act, 1947. In dealing with that question Lord Asquith expressed the
same principle as follows:</p>

<p style='text-align:justify'>&quot;If you are bidden to treat an imaginary
state of affairs as real, you must surely unless prohibited from doing so, also
imagine as real the consequence and incidents which if the putative state of
affairs had in fact existed, must inevitably have flowed from or accompanied
it. One of these in this case is emancipation from the 1939 level of rents. The
statute says that you must imagine a certain state of affairs; it does not say
that, having done so, you must cause or permit your imagination to boggle when
it comes to the inevitable corollaries of that state of affairs.&quot;</p>

<p style='text-align:justify'>8. The last argument addressed on behalf of the
petitioner is that the Deputy Commissioner actually tried the suit under the
Civil Procedure Code and so the appeal before the Commissioner of Chotanagpur
Division was not competent. It was pointed out by learned Counsel that the
lease was executed between the parties in the town of <st1:City w:st="on">Chaibassa</st1:City>
within the limits of <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Chaibassa</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType
w:st="on">Municipality</st1:PlaceType>, and even under the Government
Notification dated 26-8-1953, the area comprised in the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">Chaibassa</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Municipality</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>
was excluded from the operation of Wilkinson's Rules.</p>

<p style='text-align:justify'>It was, however, admitted that the lease was with
regard to certain lands in the Kolhan area and the order of the Deputy
Commissioner, dated 1-2-1954, shows that he had jurisdiction to treat the suit
as a Kolhan suit. It was argued on behalf of the petitioner that the Deputy
Commissioner actually decided to try the suit under the Civil Procedure Code,
but I do not think that his contention is supported by the wording of the order
of the Deputy Commissioner dated 1-2-1954. The relevant portion of the Order is
as follows:</p>

<p style='text-align:justify'>&quot;The argument of the learned Advocate for
the defendant is that the plaintiff has based his claim only on an agreement
executed at Chaibassa and therefore this suit be treated as a Kolhan suit but
should be taken cognizance of by the Subordinate Judge having jurisdiction over
Chaibassa where the agreement was executed. The G. P. on the other hand points
out that according to his plaint the claim has reference to properties situated
in Kolhan as also the agreement executed at Chaibassa and therefore both courts
have jurisdiction in this suit.</p>

<p style='text-align:justify'>I find that there is force in Government
pleader's argument. In effect however this would be little difficult because I
am also competent to take cognizance as a regular Subordinate Judge and whether
trying the suit as a Kolhan Suit or regular Subordinate Judge, I shall follow
the regular procedure prescribed by the C. P. C.</p>

<p style='text-align:justify'>I however hold that as the claim has reference
both for properties, whether situated in Kolhan as also to the agreement at
Chaibassa, this court even as <st1:Street w:st="on"><st1:address w:st="on">Kolhan
  Court</st1:address></st1:Street> is competent to take cognizance. This issue
is therefore decided in favour of the plaintiff. The remaining issues are
amended after hearing both parties.&quot;</p>

<p style='text-align:justify'>On reading the order sheet I am of opinion that
the Deputy Commissioner of Chaibassa has tried the suit as a Kolhan suit and
not as a suit instituted under the provisions of the Civil Procedure Code and,
therefore, the appeal before the Commissioner of Chotanagpur was competent.</p>

<p style='text-align:justify'>9. For these reasons the application fails and
must be dismissed with costs. Hearing fee Rs. 100/-.</p>

<p style='text-align:justify'>Kanhaiya Singh, J.</p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'>10. I agree.</p>
