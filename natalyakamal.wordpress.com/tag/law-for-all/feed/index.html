										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">From its inception, a civil trial passes through certain stages, until its final conclusion. While each case has its own peculiarities, the broad steps remain the same, illustrated in my chart below, followed by a brief description.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>1. FILING OF CASE:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Plaintiff files the case. This is done by dropping the entire case file (see <em><a href="https://natalyakamal.wordpress.com/2016/10/19/content-of-a-civil-case-file/">Contents of Civil Case File</a>) </em>  into a petition box located in the district court premises.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Cases are then marked to be heard by a particular civil judge. (Since 2012 Islamabad has been divided into two Sessions Divisions, East &amp; West. See details on the following <a href="https://districtcourtsislamabadwest.com/judiciaryHistory.php">link.)</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The frequent terms you may hear in preparation of a case are:</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li><strong>Vakalatnama: </strong></li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left:30px;text-align:justify;">A document by which a person gives authority to a lawyer to represent them in court; a power of attorney in favour of a lawyer. There is a set format which lawyers use with minor variations. See sample <em>Vakalatnama</em> in English <a href="https://lhc.gov.pk/system/files/power_of_attorney.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>, one in Urdu <a href="https://lhc.gov.pk/system/files/power_of_attorney_civil_urdu.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>, and one in Urdu for criminal cases <a href="https://lhc.gov.pk/system/files/power_of_attorney_criminal_urdu.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li><strong>Plaint, Plaintiff &amp; Defendant:</strong></li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left:30px;text-align:justify;">A Plaint is the written allegation submitted to the court. The person who files it is called the Plaintiff and against whom it is filed is called the Defendant. For example if a case title is,<em> Ahmad Bilal (“AB”) v Chaudry Daud (“CD”) </em>*, Ahmad Bilal would be the Plaintiff, one who has filed the case in court, and Chaudry Daud would be the Defendant, meaning the person who has to reply to the allegations and defend the case.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">          * <em>Fictitious characters</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>2. SUMMONING OF DEFENDANT:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Defendant, <strong>CD </strong>in our example above, needs to be informed that there is a case against him and consequently, has to appear in court to give his version of the facts. The court uses a process to enforce a Defendant&#8217;s attendance, through sending summons (on the address of the Defendant via courier and registered post). Failing the Defendant&#8217;s presence, despite summons being served on him, the court gives a last chance for appearance, by ordering a newspaper advertisement to be published informing him about the case. After this the case proceeds without the Defendant. (called &#8220;Ex parte&#8221; proceedings).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>3. FILING OF WRITTEN STATEMENT:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The written reply filed by the Defendant, presenting his side of the story, is called a Written Statement. Once the Defendant appears in court he is given time to file his Written Statement along with all supporting documents.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>4. FRAMING OF ISSUES:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After reviewing both the Plaint and Written Statement, the judge will pose questions that he/she feels need to be answered to reach a decision. This process is called Framing of Issues. Furthermore, these issues . These issues are either for the Plaintiff to prove (Onus to Prove on Plaintiff [OPP]) or for the Defendant to prove [OPD]. Thereafter, the parties call witnesses who give evidence in light of these questions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is also the last stage (within seven days of framing of issues) at which the parties must submit a list of persons who they intend to call as witnesses to the court.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>5. EVIDENCE OF PLAINTIFF:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anything you present to the court to support your case is evidence and it is of two types, oral (what you say in court on oath as a witness) and documentary (the documents you present in court as a witness). The evidence of Plaintiff is conducted in two stages, firstly examination in chief (your lawyer asking you questions to bring out your story) and secondly, cross examination (other party’s lawyer asking you question to discredit your story).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">6. EVIDENCE OF DEFENDANT:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Same as point no 5 above, except that it is now the Defendant&#8217;s turn to give evidence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>7. FINAL ARGUMENTS OF PLAINTIFF:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Final Arguments are a summary of the entire case including evidence and relevant law. The Plaintiff has the first turn.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>8. FINAL ARGUMENTS OF DEFENDANT: </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Defendant&#8217;s turn to give summary of his version of the case.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>9. JUDGMENT PRONOUNCED:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Judge decides the case according to the issues framed and answers them according to the evidence he/she has heard. He/she gives his/her detailed reasons for concluding the case for or against the Plaintiff.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>10. DECREE DRAWN UP:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A decree is the formal expression of the final outcome of the case in light of the  Judgment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Note: A civil trial is rarely as straightforward as the above process shows. At different stages one party or the other, often file applications under different provisions of the procedural rules (for e.g. Application for rejection of plaint due to either being barred by law, or the plaint not disclosing a cause of action). When this happens the other party files a reply to that application. Thereafter, the judge hears arguments on that particular application and gives an order either accepting or dismissing the application. Only after disposal of applications does the case proceed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The detailed procedure to be followed in civil cases is contained in the Code of Civil Procedure 1908 available <a href="http://pakistancode.gov.pk/english/UY2FqaJw1-apaUY2Fqa-apeb-sg-jjjjjjjjjjjjj" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. The law relating to evidence is found in the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order 1984 available <a href="http://pakistancode.gov.pk/english/UY2FqaJw1-apaUY2Fqa-apaUY2FwbJs%3D-sg-jjjjjjjjjjjjj" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><u>Note:</u> Only LHC has been illustrated as the same structure applies for all other High Courts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><u><a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov.pk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Supreme Court of Pakistan</a> (SCP)</u></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The highest court of Pakistan. The SCP sits in Islamabad with branch registries in Lahore, Karachi, Peshawar and Quetta (meaning parties can file cases and get them heard in provincial capitals at these branch registries).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The SCP primarily hears appeals from High Courts and direct constitutional petitions on enforcement of fundamental rights which contain a public element. It is also the exclusive forum for disputes between Federal and Provincial Governments. It has a Shariat Appellate Bench, which hears appeals from Federal Shariat Court.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>High Courts</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The highest court of a respective province. There are a total of five High Courts, one for each province and one for Islamabad.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="http://www.sindhhighcourt.gov.pk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sindh High Court</a> has its principal seat at Karachi and benches in Hyderabad, Sukkur and Larkana.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="http://www.lhc.gov.pk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lahore High Court</a> has its principal seat at Lahore and benches in Rawalpindi, Multan and Bhawalpur.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="http://www.peshawarhighcourt.gov.pk/index.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Peshawar High Court</a> has its principal seat at Peshawar and benches at Abbottabad, D.I. Khan, Mingora and Bannu.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="http://www.bhc.gov.pk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Balochistan High Court</a> has its principal seat at Quetta and benches at Sibi and Turbat.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="http://www.ihc.gov.pk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Islamabad High Court</a> only sits at Islamabad.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The High Courts primarily hear appeals from subordinate courts and also direct constitutional petitions under Article 199 of the Constitution, regarding enforcement of fundamental rights. Sindh High Court and Islamabad High Court also have powers to hear civil suits of certain categories if the case is above a certain value.  A High Court&#8217;s jurisdiction is limited to the province.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <a href="http://www.federalshariatcourt.gov.pk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Federal Shariat Court</a> (FSC) sits at Islamabad with bench registries at Karachi, Lahore, Quetta and Peshawar. FSC has the power to examine and determine whether laws of Pakistan are in accordance with Islamic injunctions. The FSC also has appellate jurisdiction for cases decided by criminal courts (Sessions Court) in relation to enforcement of Hudood.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><u>Subordinate Judiciary</u></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Under the High Court’s control, subordinate judiciary can be divided in to two different categories: Civil Courts and Criminal Courts.</p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;">
<li><strong>Civil courts</strong>:</li>
</ol>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li style="text-align:left;">District Judge (DJ): The highest court of original civil jurisdiction within the subordinate judiciary is that of the District Judge (there is a District Judge for each administrative district in the province). District Judge mostly hears appeals from courts of civil judges and certain matters on civil side cannot be tried by a lesser court than a district court.</li>
<li>Additional District Judge (ADJ): The ADJ has the same powers as DJ. It shares the case load of the DJ but works under its supervisory control.</li>
<li>Senior Civil Judge and Civil Judges Class I, II &amp; III: A civil suit (civil case) is heard by civil judges. According to the value of the case it is assigned to different categories of civil judges.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Civil Judges hearing cases under  special laws, are referred to by the particular terminology of the special law. For e.g. Civil Judges hearing a family cases or child custody cases are referred to as Family Judge, or Guardian Judge respectively.</p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;" start="2">
<li><strong>Criminal courts:</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>Sessions Judge: The District Judge is referred to as &#8220;sessions judge&#8221; when he/she presides over criminal matters. Mostly one refers to them together by the term District &amp; Sessions Judge (D&amp;SJ).  Sessions Judge mostly hears appeals from courts of magistrates and certain matters on criminal side cannot be tried by a lesser court than a session court (for eg. murder, certain Hadd offences, rape).</li>
<li>Additional Sessions Judge: The ADJ has the same powers as DJ. It shares the case load of the DJ but works under its supervisory control.</li>
<li>Judicial Magistrate Class I, II &amp; III. All other criminal trials are heard by Magistrates. Again like the D&amp;SJ, it is usually one person who is given powers of both Civil Judge and Magistrate.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are also various Special Courts &amp; Tribunals, created by special laws which are functioning under the administrative control of the High Court &amp; the Government respectively. Some examples are given in the chart. These are created by some special law for example the Environment Tribunal was set up pursuant to the Pakistan Environment Protection Act 1997. See this <a href="http://www.molaw.gov.pk/orgDetails.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">link</a> on the website of Ministry of Law &amp; Justice for some details regarding the special courts and tribunals.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NOTE</span>: Separate judicial system exists for Gilgit-Baltistan &amp; Azad Kashmir.</p>
