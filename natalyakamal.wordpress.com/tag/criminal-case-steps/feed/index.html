<p class="has-text-align-justify">A criminal trial, like its counter part civil trial, passes through certain distinct stages, till its final conclusion.&nbsp;Outlined below are the stages of a criminal trial (with a chart), followed by a brief description.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To understand a criminal trial we must first classify offences into three categories.&nbsp;(there can be more ways of classifying offences)</p>



<p><strong><u>CLASSIFICATION OF OFFENCES:</u></strong><strong><u></u></strong></p>



<p>A basic distinction can be drawn between offences according to whether they are:</p>
</div></div>



<ol class="wp-block-list" type="A"><li>cognizable or non cognizable,&nbsp;</li><li>bailable or non bailable,&nbsp;</li><li>compoundable or non compoundable,&nbsp;</li></ol>



<ol class="wp-block-list"><li><strong><em>COGNIZABLE &amp; NON-COGNIZABLE OFFENCES:</em></strong></li></ol>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container is-layout-flow wp-block-group-is-layout-flow">
<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container is-layout-flow wp-block-group-is-layout-flow">
<p class="has-text-align-justify">The main distinction between offences is if they fall into cognizable offences or non cognizable offences. Simply put, a cognizable case is one in which police has jurisdiction meaning that they can register the case (an First Information Report (“<strong>FIR</strong>”), investigate and a police officer can arrest without a warrant. In non cognizable offences, police has no power to investigate unless ordered to do so by a magistrate. The police cannot arrest without a warrant. The Police enters the information received about non cognizable case in a prescribed register&nbsp;<em>(roznamcha)</em>&nbsp;and refers the informant to Magistrate. Once the Magistrate so orders the police officer can start investigation. They are also known commonly as complaint cases. See Section 4(1)(f) &amp; (n) Cr.PC.&nbsp;</p>
</div></div>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">For our Stages of Criminal Trial we are confining ourselves to cognizable cases only. The two main laws, regulating criminal trial are the<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.pakistancode.gov.pk/english/UY2FqaJw1-apaUY2Fqa-apea-sg-jjjjjjjjjjjjj" target="_blank"> Code of Criminal Procdure 1898</a> (“CrPC”) and the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.pakistancode.gov.pk/english/UY2FqaJw1-apaUY2Fqa-apk%3D-sg-jjjjjjjjjjjjj">&nbsp;Pakistan Penal Code 1860</a> (“PPC”). Schedule II of the CrPC gives a breakdown of all offences according to these three distinctions and more. We see an example of theft, section 378 PPC which according to Schedule II gives us the following basic information:</p>
</div></div>

<p><em>2. <strong>BAILABLE &amp; NON BAILABLE OFFENCES:&nbsp;</strong></em></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Every criminal offence will have a corresponding entry of whether it is bailable or not. A bailable offence is one in which being given bail is a matter of right, as opposed to non bailable offences in which there is no right except when granted by a court. Generally offences in which punishment is death or imprisonment over 10 years are non bailable.</p>



<p><em>3. <strong>COMPOUNDABLE &amp; NON COMPOUNDABLE OFFENCES:</strong></em></p>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container is-layout-flow wp-block-group-is-layout-flow">
<p class="has-text-align-justify">Compoundable offences are those offences where, the Complainant can enter into a compromise with the Accused and as a result the charges are dropped. They are generally non serious offences. The courts permission is needed for compounding offence. A non compoundable offence is that in which the crime is so serious that the State (representing society) is considered to be aggrieved and no compromise is allowed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong><u>NOTE:</u></strong>&nbsp;Sometimes offences are also classified are according to the forum in which the trial will take place. It could be Magistrate Court (s.241-250), Session Court or the High Court (s.265-A to 265-N) Column 8 of Schedule II.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">From its title a criminal case can be recognized as one party, generally speaking is the “State” (سرکار<em>)</em>. For e.g. a case titled as “<em>State v Ahmad Bilal&nbsp;</em>*,” already gives you the information that it is a criminal case and that Ahmad Bilal is the Accused. The person who is the victim and who files the case is called the Complainant whose name does not show in title of case. If Ahmad Bilal is accused of stealing a watch (i.e s. 378 PPC) from Faizan Hameed then, Faizan is the Complainant who will file for registration of FIR etc. State is represented by a Public Prosecutor and usually Complainant hires their own private lawyer too.</p>



<p class="has-small-font-size"><em>*Fictitious character&nbsp;</em></p>
</div></div>



<p>The stages may differ according the fact of the case but broadly speaking the Stages that a criminal case will follow are:&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://natalyakamal.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/stages.of_.criminal.case_.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://natalyakamal.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/stages.of_.criminal.case_.jpg" alt="" /></a><figcaption><em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://natalyakamal.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/stages.of_.criminal.case_.jpg" target="_blank">Click to enlarge</a></em></figcaption></figure>



<ol class="wp-block-list" type="1"><li><strong><u>REGISTRATION OF FIR:</u></strong></li></ol>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">First Information Report is formal record of a complaint by the police in cognizable cases and the first stage at which a criminal case takes birth. Lodged at the police station it has a set format. Police officers have to reduced it into writing if given orally or if in writing, read over to complainant and signed by him. The complainant is entitled to a free copy of the FIR.&nbsp;&nbsp;(see for FIR Section. 154 CrPC)</p>



<p>2. <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">INVESTIGATION:</span></strong></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">After registration of FIR, the police has to begin investigation of the case. Investigation&nbsp;includes all proceedings for collection of evidence conducted by police officer or person authorized by a magistrate. Investigation is conducted by police officer or any officer authorized by a magistrate but cannot be conducted by magistrate himself. (See S. 4(1)(l) CrPC). Investigation leads an Investigation Officer (“IO”) to reach conclusion whether charge sheet (<em>Challan</em>) or a closure report (<em>akhraj muqaddama)</em>&nbsp;has to be filed. Statements of witnesses are recorded (s. 161 CrPC) and if needed reports ranging from site plans, post mortem, injury, medical to forensics are obtained.&nbsp;</p>



<p>3. <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">ARREST &amp; BAIL:</span></strong></p>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container is-layout-flow wp-block-group-is-layout-flow">
<p class="has-text-align-justify">If for purposes of investigation, an Accused (against whom police thinks there is sufficient evidence) has been arrested, the police has to produce the arrested person before a Magistrate within 24 hours. The Court may then either:</p>



<div class="wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-1 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex">
<div class="wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow" style="flex-basis:33.33%;">
<p>i)<em> remand to police custody; Further investigation needed; ‘Remand’ denotes sending back a person into custody to secure investigation or trial. Commonly referred to as &#8220;Physical</em> <em>remand&#8221;</em>. <em>Police can interrogate Accused &amp; confine him at the police station</em>.</p>
</div>



<div class="wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow" style="flex-basis:33.33%;">
<p>ii) <em>remand to judicial custody;</em> <em>Commonly referred to as &#8220;Judicial&#8221;. Accused is no longer in police custody and is moved to district jail&nbsp;         </em></p>
</div>



<div class="wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow" style="flex-basis:33.33%;">
<p>iii) <em>release on bail</em>; <em>Bail can be of two kinds pre arrest or post arrest.</em></p>
</div>
</div>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">If according to classification of offence in Schedule II the offence is not one requiring a warrant, a summon is issued to Accused person. Summon means there is only attendance to be procured and no detention by the police.</p>
</div></div>



<p>4. <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">POLICE REPORT (CHALLAN):</span></strong></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">The police report under Section 173 CrPc commonly known as&nbsp;<em>challan&nbsp;</em>containing the opinion of police on basis of all investigation and material collected is submitted in court. The police recommends either charging the Accused or cancelling the case. The police report is a summary of how an offence was committed and role of each person involved in crime. If any persons were investigated and not charged due to lack of evidence they are also included in it. Filing of Police Report means that the investigation in case is over and now court has to consider the evidence collected by the police. Report u/s 173 is in form prescribed by government. That form has seven columns namely:</p>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container is-layout-flow wp-block-group-is-layout-flow">
<p><em>Column No 1</em>:&nbsp;name of the informant</p>



<p><em>Column No 2</em>:&nbsp;names of the persons who have not been challaned&nbsp;including the names of the persons absconding</p>



<p><em>Column&nbsp;&nbsp;No 3</em>:&nbsp;Names of the accused persons who have been challaned and are in custody</p>



<p><em>Column&nbsp;&nbsp;No 4</em>:&nbsp;Names of persons who have been challaned but are on bail&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Column&nbsp;&nbsp;No 5</em>:&nbsp;Details of the property recovered during investigation</p>



<p><em>Column&nbsp;&nbsp;No 6</em>:&nbsp;Names and addresses of the prosecution witnesses</p>



<p><em>Column&nbsp;&nbsp;No 7</em>:&nbsp;A statement of the facts of the case alongwith opinion of the investigation officer and the offences which in the opinion of the investigation officer have been committed.&nbsp;</p>
</div></div>



<p>5. <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">FRAMING OF CHARGE:</span></strong></p>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container is-layout-flow wp-block-group-is-layout-flow">
<p class="has-text-align-justify">Framing of charges mean that the court looks into the evidence collected by the police and applies its mind so as to what are the charges under which an accused has to be booked. The Charge is read out to the Accused who enters his plea on the Charges of either “Guilty” or “Not Guilty”. The first plea puts an end to the trial and only conviction is left whereas the latter plea means that now the trial will commence.&nbsp;</p>
</div></div>



<p>6. <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">RECORDING OF PROSECUTION EVIDENCE:</span></strong></p>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container is-layout-flow wp-block-group-is-layout-flow">
<p class="has-text-align-justify">After the charges have been framed against an Accused, the prosecution is required to produce before the court, all the evidence collected by the police including producing prosecution witnesses (PWs).&nbsp; The witnesses brought by the prosecution are expected to support the case presented by the prosecution and if they fail to do so, they are declared hostile and the prosecution may request the court not to rely on the statement of such a witness. In case the witness supports the case of the prosecution, the defence (Accused’s side) is entitled to cross examine the witness so that they could find out the discrepancies in the statement of the witness concerned.&nbsp;</p>
</div></div>



<p>7. <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">STATEMENT OF THE ACCUSED:</span></strong></p>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container is-layout-flow wp-block-group-is-layout-flow">
<p class="has-text-align-justify">Section 342 of the CrPC empowers the court to ask for an explanation from the Accused. The basic idea is to give an opportunity of being heard to an Accused and explain the facts and circumstances appearing in the evidence against him. This statement is not on oath and Accused may refuse to answer the questions so asked. The answers given by the Accused may be taken into consideration in such inquiry or trial, and put in evidence for or against him. It is usually in the form of questions and answers.</p>
</div></div>



<p>8.<span style="text-decoration:underline;"> <strong>EVIDENCE OF DEFENSE:</strong></span></p>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container is-layout-flow wp-block-group-is-layout-flow">
<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container is-layout-flow wp-block-group-is-layout-flow">
<p class="has-text-align-justify">After the statement of the Accused is over, the Court applies its mind and tries to find out if the Accused has committed any offence or not. The Court can either acquit the Accused or convict the Accused. In cases of Accused not being acquitted by the Court, the defence is given an opportunity to present any defence evidence in support of the Accused. The defence can also produce its witnesses and the said witnesses are cross examined by the prosecution. Generally, in Pakistan the defence does not provide defence evidence as the criminal justice system puts burden of proof on the prosecution to prove that a person is guilty of an offence beyond the reasonable doubt.</p>
</div></div>
</div></div>



<p>9. <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">FINAL ARGUMENTS:</span></strong></p>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container is-layout-flow wp-block-group-is-layout-flow">
<p class="has-text-align-justify">Another term for final submission. Once the defence evidence of the Accused is over, the prosecution presents its final arguments. In final arguments, the prosecution generally sum up its case against the accused. After the final arguments of the prosecution are over, the defence also present its final arguments. After the final arguments of both the sides are over, the court generally reserve its judgment.</p>
</div></div>



<p>10. <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">DELIVERY OF JUDGMENT:</span></strong></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">After application of mind, the judge delivers a final judgment holding an accused guilty of offence or acquitting him of the particular offence. If a person is acquitted, the prosecution may file an appeal and if a person is convicted of a particular offence, then sentence is announced.&nbsp;He may also avail appeal in a higher court. </p>
