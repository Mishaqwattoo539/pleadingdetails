<p>First Information Report (“<em>FIR</em>”), is a written complaint that is filed with the police, at the relevant police station, about the commission of an offense. It can be filed by a victim or witness to a crime. Police does not have to wait for an informant to come forward and has power to take cognizance on their own as well. It is the first step in the criminal justice process and sets the criminal law in motion.</p>

<p>FIR has the following characteristics:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Purpose:</strong> The primary purpose of an FIR is to provide the police with the necessary information about the alleged crime. It contains details such as the date, time, and location of the incident, the names and addresses of the victims and witnesses, a description of the offense, and any other relevant information. FIR has to be lodged promptly, at the earliest so that the details of incident are not forgotten or embellished. Delay in registration of FIR may cause a suspicion as to it being an afterthought or a concocted version.</li>



<li><strong>Recording and Investigation:</strong> Once an FIR is filed, the police are obligated to record it in writing, read it over, obtain signatures and provide a copy to the complainant free of cost. Police begins the investigation after this and takes necessary actions, such as collecting evidence, questioning witnesses, and arrest of suspects.</li>



<li><strong>Cognizable Offenses:</strong> FIR is filed only for cognizable offenses (offenses that the police can investigate without requiring a court order for more on cognizable v non cognizable offenses <em>See </em><a href="https://natalyakamal.wordpress.com/2021/05/11/stages-of-a-criminal-trial-cognizable-cases/">https://natalyakamal.wordpress.com/2021/05/11/stages-of-a-criminal-trial-cognizable-cases/</a>. In non cognizable cases, the police enter a complaint in the Daily Diary (<em>Roznamcha</em>)and send it to concerned Magistrate. They cannot investigation or arrest without a Magistrates approval.</li>



<li><strong>Not Conclusive Proof:</strong> FIR is not conclusive proof of guilt and is not a substantial piece of evidence. It is merely the first step in the criminal justice process, and guilt or innocence is determined through a trial in a court of law. As first step it has some value nevertheless, as contents of FIR become crucial in evaluating investigation and case of prosecution.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>What </strong><strong>to mention in </strong><strong>FIR</strong><strong>:</strong><strong> </strong><strong></strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Your name and address;</li>



<li>Date, Time and Location of the incident you are reporting; (<em>FIR is lodged in police station having territorial jurisdiction i.e geographical limits where crime took place)</em></li>



<li>The true facts of the incident as they occurred, including the use of weapons, if any;</li>



<li>Names and description of the persons involved in the incident;</li>



<li>Names and addresses of witnesses, if any.</li>



<li>Reason for delay, if any.</li>
</ul>



<p></p>



<p><strong>Non registration:</strong></p>



<p>It is a duty of police to register a FIR without any delay or excuses. Non-registration of FIR is an offence and can be a ground for disciplinary action against the concerned police officer. In case of non registration a complaint to the higher up in police hierarchy is an option, a private complaint before a court can be filed as well as an application under s. 22-A of CrPC 1898 for registration of a FIR.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-justify">A criminal trial, like its counter part civil trial, passes through certain distinct stages, till its final conclusion.&nbsp;Outlined below are the stages of a criminal trial (with a chart), followed by a brief description.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To understand a criminal trial we must first classify offences into three categories.&nbsp;(there can be more ways of classifying offences)</p>



<p><strong><u>CLASSIFICATION OF OFFENCES:</u></strong><strong><u></u></strong></p>



<p>A basic distinction can be drawn between offences according to whether they are:</p>
</div></div>



<ol class="wp-block-list" type="A"><li>cognizable or non cognizable,&nbsp;</li><li>bailable or non bailable,&nbsp;</li><li>compoundable or non compoundable,&nbsp;</li></ol>



<ol class="wp-block-list"><li><strong><em>COGNIZABLE &amp; NON-COGNIZABLE OFFENCES:</em></strong></li></ol>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container is-layout-flow wp-block-group-is-layout-flow">
<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container is-layout-flow wp-block-group-is-layout-flow">
<p class="has-text-align-justify">The main distinction between offences is if they fall into cognizable offences or non cognizable offences. Simply put, a cognizable case is one in which police has jurisdiction meaning that they can register the case (an First Information Report (“<strong>FIR</strong>”), investigate and a police officer can arrest without a warrant. In non cognizable offences, police has no power to investigate unless ordered to do so by a magistrate. The police cannot arrest without a warrant. The Police enters the information received about non cognizable case in a prescribed register&nbsp;<em>(roznamcha)</em>&nbsp;and refers the informant to Magistrate. Once the Magistrate so orders the police officer can start investigation. They are also known commonly as complaint cases. See Section 4(1)(f) &amp; (n) Cr.PC.&nbsp;</p>
</div></div>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">For our Stages of Criminal Trial we are confining ourselves to cognizable cases only. The two main laws, regulating criminal trial are the<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.pakistancode.gov.pk/english/UY2FqaJw1-apaUY2Fqa-apea-sg-jjjjjjjjjjjjj" target="_blank"> Code of Criminal Procdure 1898</a> (“CrPC”) and the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.pakistancode.gov.pk/english/UY2FqaJw1-apaUY2Fqa-apk%3D-sg-jjjjjjjjjjjjj">&nbsp;Pakistan Penal Code 1860</a> (“PPC”). Schedule II of the CrPC gives a breakdown of all offences according to these three distinctions and more. We see an example of theft, section 378 PPC which according to Schedule II gives us the following basic information:</p>

<p><em>2. <strong>BAILABLE &amp; NON BAILABLE OFFENCES:&nbsp;</strong></em></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Every criminal offence will have a corresponding entry of whether it is bailable or not. A bailable offence is one in which being given bail is a matter of right, as opposed to non bailable offences in which there is no right except when granted by a court. Generally offences in which punishment is death or imprisonment over 10 years are non bailable.</p>



<p><em>3. <strong>COMPOUNDABLE &amp; NON COMPOUNDABLE OFFENCES:</strong></em></p>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container is-layout-flow wp-block-group-is-layout-flow">
<p class="has-text-align-justify">Compoundable offences are those offences where, the Complainant can enter into a compromise with the Accused and as a result the charges are dropped. They are generally non serious offences. The courts permission is needed for compounding offence. A non compoundable offence is that in which the crime is so serious that the State (representing society) is considered to be aggrieved and no compromise is allowed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong><u>NOTE:</u></strong>&nbsp;Sometimes offences are also classified are according to the forum in which the trial will take place. It could be Magistrate Court (s.241-250), Session Court or the High Court (s.265-A to 265-N) Column 8 of Schedule II.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">From its title a criminal case can be recognized as one party, generally speaking is the “State” (سرکار<em>)</em>. For e.g. a case titled as “<em>State v Ahmad Bilal&nbsp;</em>*,” already gives you the information that it is a criminal case and that Ahmad Bilal is the Accused. The person who is the victim and who files the case is called the Complainant whose name does not show in title of case. If Ahmad Bilal is accused of stealing a watch (i.e s. 378 PPC) from Faizan Hameed then, Faizan is the Complainant who will file for registration of FIR etc. State is represented by a Public Prosecutor and usually Complainant hires their own private lawyer too.</p>



<p class="has-small-font-size"><em>*Fictitious character&nbsp;</em></p>
</div></div>



<p>The stages may differ according the fact of the case but broadly speaking the Stages that a criminal case will follow are:&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://natalyakamal.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/stages.of_.criminal.case_.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://natalyakamal.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/stages.of_.criminal.case_.jpg" alt="" /></a><figcaption><em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://natalyakamal.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/stages.of_.criminal.case_.jpg" target="_blank">Click to enlarge</a></em></figcaption></figure>



<ol class="wp-block-list" type="1"><li><strong><u>REGISTRATION OF FIR:</u></strong></li></ol>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">First Information Report is formal record of a complaint by the police in cognizable cases and the first stage at which a criminal case takes birth. Lodged at the police station it has a set format. Police officers have to reduced it into writing if given orally or if in writing, read over to complainant and signed by him. The complainant is entitled to a free copy of the FIR.&nbsp;&nbsp;(see for FIR Section. 154 CrPC)</p>



<p>2. <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">INVESTIGATION:</span></strong></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">After registration of FIR, the police has to begin investigation of the case. Investigation&nbsp;includes all proceedings for collection of evidence conducted by police officer or person authorized by a magistrate. Investigation is conducted by police officer or any officer authorized by a magistrate but cannot be conducted by magistrate himself. (See S. 4(1)(l) CrPC). Investigation leads an Investigation Officer (“IO”) to reach conclusion whether charge sheet (<em>Challan</em>) or a closure report (<em>akhraj muqaddama)</em>&nbsp;has to be filed. Statements of witnesses are recorded (s. 161 CrPC) and if needed reports ranging from site plans, post mortem, injury, medical to forensics are obtained.&nbsp;</p>



<p>3. <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">ARREST &amp; BAIL:</span></strong></p>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container is-layout-flow wp-block-group-is-layout-flow">
<p class="has-text-align-justify">If for purposes of investigation, an Accused (against whom police thinks there is sufficient evidence) has been arrested, the police has to produce the arrested person before a Magistrate within 24 hours. The Court may then either:</p>



<div class="wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-1 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex">
<div class="wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow" style="flex-basis:33.33%;">
<p>i)<em> remand to police custody; Further investigation needed; ‘Remand’ denotes sending back a person into custody to secure investigation or trial. Commonly referred to as &#8220;Physical</em> <em>remand&#8221;</em>. <em>Police can interrogate Accused &amp; confine him at the police station</em>.</p>
</div>



<div class="wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow" style="flex-basis:33.33%;">
<p>ii) <em>remand to judicial custody;</em> <em>Commonly referred to as &#8220;Judicial&#8221;. Accused is no longer in police custody and is moved to district jail&nbsp;         </em></p>
</div>



<div class="wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow" style="flex-basis:33.33%;">
<p>iii) <em>release on bail</em>; <em>Bail can be of two kinds pre arrest or post arrest.</em></p>
</div>
</div>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">If according to classification of offence in Schedule II the offence is not one requiring a warrant, a summon is issued to Accused person. Summon means there is only attendance to be procured and no detention by the police.</p>
</div></div>



<p>4. <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">POLICE REPORT (CHALLAN):</span></strong></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">The police report under Section 173 CrPc commonly known as&nbsp;<em>challan&nbsp;</em>containing the opinion of police on basis of all investigation and material collected is submitted in court. The police recommends either charging the Accused or cancelling the case. The police report is a summary of how an offence was committed and role of each person involved in crime. If any persons were investigated and not charged due to lack of evidence they are also included in it. Filing of Police Report means that the investigation in case is over and now court has to consider the evidence collected by the police. Report u/s 173 is in form prescribed by government. That form has seven columns namely:</p>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container is-layout-flow wp-block-group-is-layout-flow">
<p><em>Column No 1</em>:&nbsp;name of the informant</p>



<p><em>Column No 2</em>:&nbsp;names of the persons who have not been challaned&nbsp;including the names of the persons absconding</p>



<p><em>Column&nbsp;&nbsp;No 3</em>:&nbsp;Names of the accused persons who have been challaned and are in custody</p>



<p><em>Column&nbsp;&nbsp;No 4</em>:&nbsp;Names of persons who have been challaned but are on bail&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Column&nbsp;&nbsp;No 5</em>:&nbsp;Details of the property recovered during investigation</p>



<p><em>Column&nbsp;&nbsp;No 6</em>:&nbsp;Names and addresses of the prosecution witnesses</p>



<p><em>Column&nbsp;&nbsp;No 7</em>:&nbsp;A statement of the facts of the case alongwith opinion of the investigation officer and the offences which in the opinion of the investigation officer have been committed.&nbsp;</p>
</div></div>



<p>5. <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">FRAMING OF CHARGE:</span></strong></p>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container is-layout-flow wp-block-group-is-layout-flow">
<p class="has-text-align-justify">Framing of charges mean that the court looks into the evidence collected by the police and applies its mind so as to what are the charges under which an accused has to be booked. The Charge is read out to the Accused who enters his plea on the Charges of either “Guilty” or “Not Guilty”. The first plea puts an end to the trial and only conviction is left whereas the latter plea means that now the trial will commence.&nbsp;</p>
</div></div>



<p>6. <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">RECORDING OF PROSECUTION EVIDENCE:</span></strong></p>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container is-layout-flow wp-block-group-is-layout-flow">
<p class="has-text-align-justify">After the charges have been framed against an Accused, the prosecution is required to produce before the court, all the evidence collected by the police including producing prosecution witnesses (PWs).&nbsp; The witnesses brought by the prosecution are expected to support the case presented by the prosecution and if they fail to do so, they are declared hostile and the prosecution may request the court not to rely on the statement of such a witness. In case the witness supports the case of the prosecution, the defence (Accused’s side) is entitled to cross examine the witness so that they could find out the discrepancies in the statement of the witness concerned.&nbsp;</p>
</div></div>



<p>7. <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">STATEMENT OF THE ACCUSED:</span></strong></p>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container is-layout-flow wp-block-group-is-layout-flow">
<p class="has-text-align-justify">Section 342 of the CrPC empowers the court to ask for an explanation from the Accused. The basic idea is to give an opportunity of being heard to an Accused and explain the facts and circumstances appearing in the evidence against him. This statement is not on oath and Accused may refuse to answer the questions so asked. The answers given by the Accused may be taken into consideration in such inquiry or trial, and put in evidence for or against him. It is usually in the form of questions and answers.</p>
</div></div>



<p>8.<span style="text-decoration:underline;"> <strong>EVIDENCE OF DEFENSE:</strong></span></p>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container is-layout-flow wp-block-group-is-layout-flow">
<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container is-layout-flow wp-block-group-is-layout-flow">
<p class="has-text-align-justify">After the statement of the Accused is over, the Court applies its mind and tries to find out if the Accused has committed any offence or not. The Court can either acquit the Accused or convict the Accused. In cases of Accused not being acquitted by the Court, the defence is given an opportunity to present any defence evidence in support of the Accused. The defence can also produce its witnesses and the said witnesses are cross examined by the prosecution. Generally, in Pakistan the defence does not provide defence evidence as the criminal justice system puts burden of proof on the prosecution to prove that a person is guilty of an offence beyond the reasonable doubt.</p>

<p class="p3" style="text-align: justify"><span class="s2">Muslim men have an inherent right of divorce. Muslim women only have this right if it has been delegated to them by the husband (<i>Talaq-e-Tafweez)</i> either at the time of marriage<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(Clause 18, Nikahnama) or afterwards. </span></p>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: justify"><span class="s2">Clause 18 of the Nikahnama reads: </span></p>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: justify"><span class="s2"><b>Whether the husband has delegated the power of divorce to the wife, if so, under what conditions? </b></span></p>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: justify"><span class="s2"><b> آیا شوہر نے طلاق کا حق بیوی کو تفویض کر دیا ہے اگر کر دیا ہے تو کونسی شرائط کے تحت؟<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></b></span></p>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: justify"><span class="s2">If a woman has been delegated this right i.e answered in the affirmative, then she will follow the same process for finalisation of divorce as the man. The relevant authority to register divorce is the concerned Arbitration Council where one files certain documents to initiate the divorce process. </span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">What is the Arbitration Council:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span class="s2">Arbitration Council means the Chairman of the Union Council along with representative of each party. Every geographical area comes under a Union Council. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Before a civil case file is ready to be dropped into the petition box (see earlier post &#8220;<em><a href="https://natalyakamal.wordpress.com/2016/07/23/stages-of-a-civil-trial/">Stages of a Civil Trial</a></em>&#8220;) there are certain formalities which need to be complied with for the file to be complete.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We already know that the Plaint is the written allegation submitted to the court. It forms the basis of the Plaintiff&#8217;s case and must be read and signed by you (the client) as well as your lawyer. However, this is not the only document that forms part of the civil case file.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The other documents which accompany the plaint are illustrated in my chart below with a brief write up followed with pictures of the appropriate forms.</p>

<p>The document served through registered post or courier to the Defendant informing him of pending litigation against him. Three copies are attached in the file for each Defendant. The copy of plaint should also be served with the summons, but that rarely ever happens and the Defendant must obtain the copy of case filed against him from the court after receiving summons in his name.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>* NOTE: Some forms (for eg. 4,5,6,7 and 9) would also be filed with the Defendant&#8217;s reply (Written Statement).</p>
<p>* NOTE: Special thanks to <strong>Saman Mamoon</strong> for procuring the court forms <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">From its inception, a civil trial passes through certain stages, until its final conclusion. While each case has its own peculiarities, the broad steps remain the same, illustrated in my chart below, followed by a brief description.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>1. FILING OF CASE:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Plaintiff files the case. This is done by dropping the entire case file (see <em><a href="https://natalyakamal.wordpress.com/2016/10/19/content-of-a-civil-case-file/">Contents of Civil Case File</a>) </em>  into a petition box located in the district court premises.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Cases are then marked to be heard by a particular civil judge. (Since 2012 Islamabad has been divided into two Sessions Divisions, East &amp; West. See details on the following <a href="https://districtcourtsislamabadwest.com/judiciaryHistory.php">link.)</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The frequent terms you may hear in preparation of a case are:</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li><strong>Vakalatnama: </strong></li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left:30px;text-align:justify;">A document by which a person gives authority to a lawyer to represent them in court; a power of attorney in favour of a lawyer. There is a set format which lawyers use with minor variations. See sample <em>Vakalatnama</em> in English <a href="https://lhc.gov.pk/system/files/power_of_attorney.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>, one in Urdu <a href="https://lhc.gov.pk/system/files/power_of_attorney_civil_urdu.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>, and one in Urdu for criminal cases <a href="https://lhc.gov.pk/system/files/power_of_attorney_criminal_urdu.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li><strong>Plaint, Plaintiff &amp; Defendant:</strong></li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left:30px;text-align:justify;">A Plaint is the written allegation submitted to the court. The person who files it is called the Plaintiff and against whom it is filed is called the Defendant. For example if a case title is,<em> Ahmad Bilal (“AB”) v Chaudry Daud (“CD”) </em>*, Ahmad Bilal would be the Plaintiff, one who has filed the case in court, and Chaudry Daud would be the Defendant, meaning the person who has to reply to the allegations and defend the case.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">          * <em>Fictitious characters</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>2. SUMMONING OF DEFENDANT:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Defendant, <strong>CD </strong>in our example above, needs to be informed that there is a case against him and consequently, has to appear in court to give his version of the facts. The court uses a process to enforce a Defendant&#8217;s attendance, through sending summons (on the address of the Defendant via courier and registered post). Failing the Defendant&#8217;s presence, despite summons being served on him, the court gives a last chance for appearance, by ordering a newspaper advertisement to be published informing him about the case. After this the case proceeds without the Defendant. (called &#8220;Ex parte&#8221; proceedings).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>3. FILING OF WRITTEN STATEMENT:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The written reply filed by the Defendant, presenting his side of the story, is called a Written Statement. Once the Defendant appears in court he is given time to file his Written Statement along with all supporting documents.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>4. FRAMING OF ISSUES:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After reviewing both the Plaint and Written Statement, the judge will pose questions that he/she feels need to be answered to reach a decision. This process is called Framing of Issues. Furthermore, these issues . These issues are either for the Plaintiff to prove (Onus to Prove on Plaintiff [OPP]) or for the Defendant to prove [OPD]. Thereafter, the parties call witnesses who give evidence in light of these questions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is also the last stage (within seven days of framing of issues) at which the parties must submit a list of persons who they intend to call as witnesses to the court.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>5. EVIDENCE OF PLAINTIFF:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anything you present to the court to support your case is evidence and it is of two types, oral (what you say in court on oath as a witness) and documentary (the documents you present in court as a witness). The evidence of Plaintiff is conducted in two stages, firstly examination in chief (your lawyer asking you questions to bring out your story) and secondly, cross examination (other party’s lawyer asking you question to discredit your story).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">6. EVIDENCE OF DEFENDANT:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Same as point no 5 above, except that it is now the Defendant&#8217;s turn to give evidence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>7. FINAL ARGUMENTS OF PLAINTIFF:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Final Arguments are a summary of the entire case including evidence and relevant law. The Plaintiff has the first turn.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>8. FINAL ARGUMENTS OF DEFENDANT: </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Defendant&#8217;s turn to give summary of his version of the case.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>9. JUDGMENT PRONOUNCED:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Judge decides the case according to the issues framed and answers them according to the evidence he/she has heard. He/she gives his/her detailed reasons for concluding the case for or against the Plaintiff.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>10. DECREE DRAWN UP:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A decree is the formal expression of the final outcome of the case in light of the  Judgment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Note: A civil trial is rarely as straightforward as the above process shows. At different stages one party or the other, often file applications under different provisions of the procedural rules (for e.g. Application for rejection of plaint due to either being barred by law, or the plaint not disclosing a cause of action). When this happens the other party files a reply to that application. Thereafter, the judge hears arguments on that particular application and gives an order either accepting or dismissing the application. Only after disposal of applications does the case proceed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The detailed procedure to be followed in civil cases is contained in the Code of Civil Procedure 1908 available <a href="http://pakistancode.gov.pk/english/UY2FqaJw1-apaUY2Fqa-apeb-sg-jjjjjjjjjjjjj" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. The law relating to evidence is found in the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order 1984 available <a href="http://pakistancode.gov.pk/english/UY2FqaJw1-apaUY2Fqa-apaUY2FwbJs%3D-sg-jjjjjjjjjjjjj" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><u>Note:</u> Only LHC has been illustrated as the same structure applies for all other High Courts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><u><a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov.pk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Supreme Court of Pakistan</a> (SCP)</u></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The highest court of Pakistan. The SCP sits in Islamabad with branch registries in Lahore, Karachi, Peshawar and Quetta (meaning parties can file cases and get them heard in provincial capitals at these branch registries).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The SCP primarily hears appeals from High Courts and direct constitutional petitions on enforcement of fundamental rights which contain a public element. It is also the exclusive forum for disputes between Federal and Provincial Governments. It has a Shariat Appellate Bench, which hears appeals from Federal Shariat Court.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>High Courts</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The highest court of a respective province. There are a total of five High Courts, one for each province and one for Islamabad.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="http://www.sindhhighcourt.gov.pk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sindh High Court</a> has its principal seat at Karachi and benches in Hyderabad, Sukkur and Larkana.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="http://www.lhc.gov.pk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lahore High Court</a> has its principal seat at Lahore and benches in Rawalpindi, Multan and Bhawalpur.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="http://www.peshawarhighcourt.gov.pk/index.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Peshawar High Court</a> has its principal seat at Peshawar and benches at Abbottabad, D.I. Khan, Mingora and Bannu.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="http://www.bhc.gov.pk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Balochistan High Court</a> has its principal seat at Quetta and benches at Sibi and Turbat.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="http://www.ihc.gov.pk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Islamabad High Court</a> only sits at Islamabad.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The High Courts primarily hear appeals from subordinate courts and also direct constitutional petitions under Article 199 of the Constitution, regarding enforcement of fundamental rights. Sindh High Court and Islamabad High Court also have powers to hear civil suits of certain categories if the case is above a certain value.  A High Court&#8217;s jurisdiction is limited to the province.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <a href="http://www.federalshariatcourt.gov.pk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Federal Shariat Court</a> (FSC) sits at Islamabad with bench registries at Karachi, Lahore, Quetta and Peshawar. FSC has the power to examine and determine whether laws of Pakistan are in accordance with Islamic injunctions. The FSC also has appellate jurisdiction for cases decided by criminal courts (Sessions Court) in relation to enforcement of Hudood.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><u>Subordinate Judiciary</u></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Under the High Court’s control, subordinate judiciary can be divided in to two different categories: Civil Courts and Criminal Courts.</p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;">
<li><strong>Civil courts</strong>:</li>
</ol>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li style="text-align:left;">District Judge (DJ): The highest court of original civil jurisdiction within the subordinate judiciary is that of the District Judge (there is a District Judge for each administrative district in the province). District Judge mostly hears appeals from courts of civil judges and certain matters on civil side cannot be tried by a lesser court than a district court.</li>
<li>Additional District Judge (ADJ): The ADJ has the same powers as DJ. It shares the case load of the DJ but works under its supervisory control.</li>
<li>Senior Civil Judge and Civil Judges Class I, II &amp; III: A civil suit (civil case) is heard by civil judges. According to the value of the case it is assigned to different categories of civil judges.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Civil Judges hearing cases under  special laws, are referred to by the particular terminology of the special law. For e.g. Civil Judges hearing a family cases or child custody cases are referred to as Family Judge, or Guardian Judge respectively.</p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;" start="2">
<li><strong>Criminal courts:</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>Sessions Judge: The District Judge is referred to as &#8220;sessions judge&#8221; when he/she presides over criminal matters. Mostly one refers to them together by the term District &amp; Sessions Judge (D&amp;SJ).  Sessions Judge mostly hears appeals from courts of magistrates and certain matters on criminal side cannot be tried by a lesser court than a session court (for eg. murder, certain Hadd offences, rape).</li>
<li>Additional Sessions Judge: The ADJ has the same powers as DJ. It shares the case load of the DJ but works under its supervisory control.</li>
<li>Judicial Magistrate Class I, II &amp; III. All other criminal trials are heard by Magistrates. Again like the D&amp;SJ, it is usually one person who is given powers of both Civil Judge and Magistrate.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are also various Special Courts &amp; Tribunals, created by special laws which are functioning under the administrative control of the High Court &amp; the Government respectively. Some examples are given in the chart. These are created by some special law for example the Environment Tribunal was set up pursuant to the Pakistan Environment Protection Act 1997. See this <a href="http://www.molaw.gov.pk/orgDetails.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">link</a> on the website of Ministry of Law &amp; Justice for some details regarding the special courts and tribunals.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NOTE</span>: Separate judicial system exists for Gilgit-Baltistan &amp; Azad Kashmir.</p>
